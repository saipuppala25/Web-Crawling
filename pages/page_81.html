by twerking while working, like the sanitation worker on Euclid Avenue moving to music that only she can hear; by watering pollinator habitats in the front yard, side yard or backyard to summon the butterflies and bees still sleepily emerging from a winter/spring slumber; by greeting a new lawn guy because the one from last summer went AWOL; by putting on sunglasses, grabbing folding chairs and reading books on front lawns next to plastic kiddie pools; by waking up to windows bathed in sunlight and rushing outside because the longer days still feel too short; by driving with the top down and the Doobie Brothers blaring on the radio; by plucking last year’s beach read from the Little Library on the corner; by aimlessly strolling through Avalon and Atlantic Station to live, work and play on a weekday; by preparing for sleep-away camps and trips to faraway places, where stress is shed like an animal molting;<b> </b>by stopping to buy fruit from the watermelon man parked in the vacant lot of a shuttered Dollar Store; by stopping to gaze up at the Ferris wheel in the parking lot at Plaza Fiesta on Buford Highway; by crossing to the shady side of every street as the mercury creeps past 80 degrees; by pulling a tan suit and blue button up from the back of the closet for a classic warm weather look; by ordering ice cream in a crisp sugary waffle cone bowl so it doesn’t drip and<b> </b>so every spoonful can be savored; by taking the kids to Six Flags now to avoid visiting when it’s 90 degrees in the shade; by delivering food on a bicycle with a cooler taped to the handlebars; by standing in parks with eyes closed and faces turned to the sky; by rushing out of school buildings and counting down the days until the school year ends; by meeting up with friends and neighbors to dine al fresco and watch movies under the stars; by leaving home with metal bottles filled to the brim with ice cold water; by shopping for new swimsuits and sundresses and sandals because … summer; by taking evening strolls and pausing to appreciate the intoxicating smell of a neighbor’s night-blooming jasmine; by cleaning up decks and pulling out grills for Memorial Day gatherings; by taking in every sight, sound, smell, taste and feeling before this too short moment of perfect outdoor weather gives way to oppressive heat and a season spent in temperature-controlled environments."},{"_id":"O4VTHDSIGRAGPJDF5GW6JDP2WE","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1716313452938},"type":"text","content":"<i>Read more on the Real Life blog (</i><a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/opinion/real-life-blog/\"><i>www.ajc.com/opinion/real-life-blog/</i></a><i>) and find Nedra on Facebook (</i><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AJCRealLifeColumn\"><i>www.facebook.com/AJCRealLifeColumn</i></a><i>) and Twitter (</i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nrhoneajc\"><i>@nrhoneajc</i></a><i>) or email her at </i><a href=\"mailto:Nedra.Rhone@ajc.com\"><i>nedra.rhone@ajc.com</i></a><i>.</i>"}],"subheadlines":{"basic":""},"description":{"basic":"From going to outdoor parties to pulling out kiddie pools, Atlantans were out and about on a day with spectacular weather."},"taxonomy":{"sections":[{"path":"/opinion","parent":{"default":"/"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/","name":"Opinion","description":"Opinion articles from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","_id":"/opinion","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"AmpNav":"/","subnav_opinion":null,"TopicsBar2023":"/","BottomNav":null,"TopNavRedesign":null,"SectionMap":"/","TopNav":null,"TopicsBar":null,"ComposerNav":"/","subnav_homepage":null,"default":"/","MainMenu2024":"/","MainMenuRedesign2021":null},"site":{"site_url":"/opinion/","section_comments_enabled":"Yes","site_description":"Opinion articles from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","site_title":"Opinion"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Opinion"},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","_website":"ajc","name":"Opinion","Sponsor":{"sponsor_url_open_new_tab":"false","sponsor_desktop_banner":"","sponsor_mobile_banner":"","sponsor_url":""},"_id":"/opinion","ancestors":{"subnav_opinion":[],"TopicsBar2023":["/"],"MainMenu2024":["/"],"TopNavRedesign":[],"SectionMap":["/"],"MainMenuRedesign2021":[],"TopNav":[],"TopicsBar":[],"ComposerNav":["/"],"subnav_homepage":[]},"order":{"AmpNav":1033,"TopicsBar2023":1008,"default":1083,"MainMenu2024":1007,"SectionMap":1085,"ComposerNav":1005}}},"_website_section_id":"ajc./opinion","type":"section","version":"0.6.0"},{"path":"/opinion/columnists","parent":{"default":"/opinion"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/opinion","name":"AJC Columnists","description":"Articles by columnists from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","_id":"/opinion/columnists","additional_properties":{"original":{"parent":{"AmpNav":"/opinion","default":"/opinion","MainMenu2024":"/opinion","BottomNav":null,"TopNavRedesign":null,"SectionMap":"/","MainMenuRedesign2021":null,"TopNav":null,"ComposerNav":"/opinion"},"site":{"section_comments_enabled":"Yes","site_description":"Articles by columnists from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","site_title":"AJC Columnists"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"AJC Columnists"},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section","_website":"ajc","name":"AJC Columnists","_id":"/opinion/columnists","ancestors":{"MainMenu2024":["/","/opinion"],"TopNavRedesign":[],"SectionMap":["/"],"MainMenuRedesign2021":[],"TopNav":[],"ComposerNav":["/opinion"]},"order":{"MainMenu2024":2002,"SectionMap":1067,"ComposerNav":2003}}},"_website_section_id":"ajc./opinion/columnists","type":"section","version":"0.6.0"},{"path":"/things-to-do","parent":{"default":"/"},"_website":"ajc","parent_id":"/","name":"Things to Do","description":"Find things to do in Atlanta, the AJC events calendar, Atlanta restaurants, Georgia festivals, things to do this weekend, Atlanta movie showtimes, festivals and concerts.
