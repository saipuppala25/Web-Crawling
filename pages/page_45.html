I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Sundance Film Festival not coming to Atlanta, focusing on smaller cities"},"first_publish_date":"2024-09-12T18:25:50.209Z","last_updated_date":"2024-09-12T22:15:26.717Z","_id":"7MXU3IC5AJAUTCRU2RFSSXRUIU"},{"content_elements":[{"_id":"GQAQ2LEJPJFVTAND2SD7LGZRQU","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[{"date":"2024-09-10T20:37:56.437Z","start":0,"end":1,"text":"changed NBA picked to NBA selected to avoid slight repetition ","user":"Amanda DeArmon","email":"Amanda.DeArmon@ajc.com"}],"_id":1725989431455},"type":"text","content":"TNT Sports has picked up another basketball property to boost its slate of live sports."},{"_id":"RT64FBD44NHTFBGC4JXGVZVFXI","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725989431456},"type":"text","content":"TNT Sports is the first U.S. broadcast partner of a new men’s college<b> </b>basketball event called the Players Era Festival, according to a news release from TNT parent company Warner Bros.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"He was the voice of Darth Vader, but James Earl Jones’ longest gig was at CNN"},"first_publish_date":"2024-09-09T22:16:53.445Z","last_updated_date":"2024-09-10T01:55:28.633Z","_id":"JMJHSRFIUZAPXKZOGO3EYX5GJ4"},{"content_elements":[{"_id":"VRHBX3LYZNB3RLA7ITTGCFAOYA","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725193418219},"type":"text","content":"Doug Turnbull has left the only full-time job he has ever had reporting traffic on WSB radio for 20 years."},{"_id":"Y4I7QYJVU5GGJLSDLZQ7OHHXW4","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[{"pos":24,"comment":", Sept. 6"}],"comments":[],"_id":1725666515994},"type":"text","content":"His final day was Friday when he flew on the traffic helicopter over metro Atlanta for a final time.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Traffic reporter Doug Turnbull leaving WSB radio after 20 years"},"first_publish_date":"2024-09-07T12:37:20.488Z","last_updated_date":"2024-09-08T19:43:34.119Z","_id":"Y7KZNDYRVZHRBET6FIGSAP6ZPE","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"178d6120f9ab86584c42b0afa82014082416d117209e3846531c008aab753113"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"MARK MCKAY","type":"author","byline":"MARK MCKAY"}]},"subtitle":"Doug Turnbull","width":1200,"caption":"Doug Turnbull at his going away party at WSB radio on Sept. 6, 2024, his final day after 20 years at the station.

I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Regal Hollywood 24 off I-85 in Chamblee shutting down after 25 years"},"first_publish_date":"2024-09-04T20:52:08.023Z","last_updated_date":"2024-09-05T12:00:32.97Z","_id":"EMTF7NF3KJETXPLPKOJT5DQWW4","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"fad98aa933ebcb0f97b4aff8d246240b68c3969f00ddf4468137af92269f747a"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"RODNEY HO/rho@ajc.com","type":"author","byline":"RODNEY HO/rho@ajc.com"}]},"subtitle":"Regal Cinema Hollywood 24","width":4032,"caption":"Regal Hollywood 24 in Chamblee is shutting down in October 2024 after 25 years off I-85.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Atlanta-based CNN ‘ticker team’ eliminated in cutbacks"},"first_publish_date":"2024-08-12T20:35:50.781Z","last_updated_date":"2024-08-13T02:00:22.586Z","_id":"O46WMPWGTZD4XGOBSY6X7Y3KQM","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"557a1418a481d56e3e413a3189c02a2fccd22c979b786403b55fc529ea76d6d9"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"CNN","type":"author","byline":"CNN"}]},"subtitle":"CNN ticker team","width":1800,"caption":"CNN's \"ticker team\" of nine Atlanta-based employees were cut last Friday, August 9, 2024 after 11 years of existence for more automated \"ticker\" feeds on the bottom of the screen.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Charles Barkley to stay with TNT, reverses retirement decision"},"first_publish_date":"2024-08-06T19:31:24.73Z","last_updated_date":"2024-08-06T19:31:24.85Z","_id":"KO35APCKBNGEZD4A7J2IYAK5TE","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"481923cf0c3d33d218418760ffed746865816ea81c3451905ebe9b5c42b8d979"},"credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"TNS","type":"author"}],"by":[{"name":"Cliff Hawkins","type":"author"}]},"subtitle":"SPORTS-BKN-TV-MEDIARIGHTS-BARKLEY-GET","width":3000,"caption":"Charles Barkley joined TNT as an analyst in 2000.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"CNN plans to cut 100 employees as network focuses on digital"},"first_publish_date":"2024-07-10T14:51:33.789Z","last_updated_date":"2024-07-11T14:43:58.065Z","_id":"GFWQNREYRZBXHEAMV72YSZZ2VY","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"bb658b36be578c526904711b32c9c241a1318a9e17d60738232e23be992e6760"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"AP PH","type":"author","byline":"AP PH"}]},"subtitle":"Mark Thompson","width":1440,"caption":"CNN president Mark Thompson in 2023.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"},{"image":{"version":"0.5.8","url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/2476496d-ea7e-47b0-ac5b-7df7d69d60e5.png"},"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links.","url":""},{"site":"twitter","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links.","url":"https://twitter.com/savokanikan/"}],"org":"Atlanta, GA","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":""},{"site":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/savokanikan/"}],"name":"Savannah Sicurella","description":"Savannah Sicurella is an entertainment business reporter with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.","_id":"savannah-sicurella","additional_properties":{"original":{"lastName":"Sicurella","education":[{"name":"University of Georgia"}],"role":"Business Reporter","native_app_rendering":false,"affiliations":"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","bio":"Savannah Sicurella is an entertainment business reporter with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.","type":"author","expertise":"7","twitter":"https://twitter.com/savokanikan/","contributor":false,"custom_ajc_website":"ajc","bio_page":"/staff/savannah-sicurella/","last_updated_date":"2024-05-07T17:41:53.157Z","byline":"Savannah Sicurella","email":"","slug":"","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/2476496d-ea7e-47b0-ac5b-7df7d69d60e5.png","longBio":"Savannah Sicurella is an entertainment business reporter with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, covering the business side of Atlanta’s booming film, television, music production, media and e-sports industries.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"},{"image":{"version":"0.5.8","url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/2476496d-ea7e-47b0-ac5b-7df7d69d60e5.png"},"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links.","url":""},{"site":"twitter","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links.","url":"https://twitter.com/savokanikan/"}],"org":"Atlanta, GA","social_links":[{"site":"email","url":""},{"site":"twitter","url":"https://twitter.com/savokanikan/"}],"name":"Savannah Sicurella","description":"Savannah Sicurella is an entertainment business reporter with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.","_id":"savannah-sicurella","additional_properties":{"original":{"lastName":"Sicurella","education":[{"name":"University of Georgia"}],"role":"Business Reporter","native_app_rendering":false,"affiliations":"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","bio":"Savannah Sicurella is an entertainment business reporter with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.","type":"author","expertise":"7","twitter":"https://twitter.com/savokanikan/","contributor":false,"custom_ajc_website":"ajc","bio_page":"/staff/savannah-sicurella/","last_updated_date":"2024-05-07T17:41:53.157Z","byline":"Savannah Sicurella","email":"","slug":"","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/2476496d-ea7e-47b0-ac5b-7df7d69d60e5.png","longBio":"Savannah Sicurella is an entertainment business reporter with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, covering the business side of Atlanta’s booming film, television, music production, media and e-sports industries.

He currently serves as an investigations editor, but for years worked as a reporter on the team. He is an Atlanta native and a graduate of the University of Georgia. Brad has written about police misconduct, abuse of aged and vulnerable citizens, and government accountability. He was part of the team that investigated Georgia's senior care homes in 2019 in the \"Unprotected\" series. That led to legislative reform in 2020 to increase protections for Georgia's seniors. He was the AJC's lead reporter on a series that detailed police shootings across Georgia. That collaboration with WSB-TV resulted in legislative reform of the state’s grand jury system in 2016. In 2013, he was part of a team at the Minneapolis Star Tribune awarded a Pulitzer for a series that exposed widespread safety failures that had been harming infants and children in Minnesota’s daycare system.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"‘Good Day Atlanta’ anchor Sharon Lawson leaves Fox 5 after seven years"},"first_publish_date":"2024-06-07T18:11:46.874Z","last_updated_date":"2024-06-11T17:19:31.304Z","_id":"U5LZD44VBBGSZEYVIEG4JQEIMA","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"63f87b9866a4758d1fe54d1d910d047554a5077c92e9c093b0b26bcc92fddd54"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"WAGA-TV","type":"author","byline":"WAGA-TV"}]},"subtitle":"Sharon Lawson","width":960,"caption":"Sharon Lawson left Fox 5 on June 5, 2024, after seven years as an anchor.

I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"width":3264,"first_publish_date":"2016-11-10T13:56:42Z","_id":"RVEZLYUZK2UOH4RVYFEYQXPSRY","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/DNPoM9_4T_n34GYtmi5756V_Mb8=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/RVEZLYUZK2UOH4RVYFEYQXPSRY.jpg","comments":[],"keywords":["radiotvtalk blog","radiotvtalk"],"proxyUrl":"/resizer/DNPoM9_4T_n34GYtmi5756V_Mb8=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/RVEZLYUZK2UOH4RVYFEYQXPSRY.jpg","takenOn":"2016-11-10T13:56:42Z","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/RVEZLYUZK2UOH4RVYFEYQXPSRY.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/DNPoM9_4T_n34GYtmi5756V_Mb8=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/RVEZLYUZK2UOH4RVYFEYQXPSRY.jpg","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/jt9ywnAG-EICXfw7-p92WzxqqIg=/300x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/RVEZLYUZK2UOH4RVYFEYQXPSRY.jpg","version":0,"originalName":"https://www.ajc.com//rw/Pub/p7/AJC/2016/11/10/Images/WPIMAGE_cmgpremajcradiotvtalk_5574.jpg","mime_type":"image/jpeg","restricted":false,"galleries":[],"_id":"5GGM3EJEIBHTTNGRNDZHMNXBA4"},"created_date":"2020-06-24T06:15:20Z","last_updated_date":"2020-06-24T06:15:20Z","publish_date":"2016-11-10T13:56:42Z","height":2448,"resized_obj":{"src":"https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/RVEZLYUZK2UOH4RVYFEYQXPSRY.jpg?auth=15ed301ce837d97340373e93bf1188c92c63d26dfd50c76f0b5b11365677af23&width=330&height=330&smart=true"}},{"_id":"2UMAUJCECNASXIONNAQUS4QLSU","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1717698325875},"type":"text","content":"Eric Anthony Leong, a Lilburn prop fabricator, has been able to find small jobs on Georgia productions since the end of the strikes.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Blog","headlines":{"basic":"What are the biggest movies shot in Georgia since 2008?

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"One year under new ownership, Tara still losing money but in better shape"},"first_publish_date":"2024-05-30T16:56:28.756Z","last_updated_date":"2024-06-11T17:20:47.469Z","_id":"LCG35GU3UZHUZFFKQRYEW3BH7Y","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"6fb053d1167b4d338e3bdce0a702871ad92b664a4792e7d46602debcec148a73"},"alt_text":"Tara Theatre","credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"image":{"version":"0.5.8","url":""},"socialLinks":[{"site":"email","deprecated":true,"deprecation_msg":"Please use social_links.","url":""}],"social_links":[{"site":"email","url":""}],"name":"Natrice Miller","description":"","_id":"natrice-miller","additional_properties":{"original":{"lastName":"Miller","image":"","role":"Photographer","education":[],"longBio":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"affiliations":"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution","bio":"","author_type":"Staff","type":"author","firstName":"Natrice","books":[],"podcasts":[],"contributor":false,"awards":[],"custom_ajc_website":"ajc","_id":"natrice-miller","bio_page":"/staff/natrice-miller/","last_updated_date":"2023-06-12T22:46:31.288Z","byline":"Natrice Miller","email":"","slug":"","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/natrice-miller/","slug":""}]},"subtitle":"Tara Theatre Opening","width":3984,"caption":"Tara Theatre owner Christopher Escobar (center) celebrates with supporters after the ribbon cutting during the grand reopening on Thursday, May 25, 2023.
