He cut his teeth in sports journalism as a breaking news writer within the mixed martial arts industry — all after earning a bachelor's degree in journalism and a bachelor's degree in English from Georgia State University.\n\nHe dedicated the following years of his career to working as a digital content producer for Cox Media Group, writing stories and crafting breaking news within the multiple-time Edward Murrow Award winning 95.5 WSB-Radio newsroom.\n\nMoving from radio to television, the next chapter of his career featured a digital producer position at WXIA-11Alive, one of Atlanta's top television news stations within the nation's top sixth market. Throughout his career, Hunter has gone on to write sports, entertainment, political and local breaking news for a variety of outlets.\n\nA nerd at heart, Hunter usually has a video game controller in his hands when he's not working. When not leveling up in the latest game, he's usually searching for new records to listen to or obsessing over Dungeons and Dragons.","fuzzy_match":false,"author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Hunter","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"_id":"hunter-boyce","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/hunter-boyce/","slug":""}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Chick-fil-A’s first elevated drive-thru opens near Atlanta this week"},"first_publish_date":"2024-08-21T18:33:09.98Z","last_updated_date":"2024-08-22T17:02:20.937Z","_id":"4UOSCTTXTRATXG7IY6XIPG5Q5U","teaseImageObject":{"credits":{},"width":1920,"type":"image","url":"https://d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/08-21-2024/t_8ed78932855b4981931405c8f9828bd1_name_CFA_Elevated_Drive_Thru_8.jpg","height":1080,"resized_obj":{"src":"https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F08-21-2024%2Ft_8ed78932855b4981931405c8f9828bd1_name_CFA_Elevated_Drive_Thru_8.jpg?auth=97c45cf69413a508324769880673678347f36dfc19f3e38ac1d035554c16a6b1&width=330&height=330&smart=true"}}},{"content_elements":[{"_id":"2ZIHOO5PDZFZXALVWHSW52MUGM","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[{"pos":0,"comment":"Story OK’d by Janel.
