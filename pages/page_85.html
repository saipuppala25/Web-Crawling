Jennifer is the former government editor of The (Nashville) Tennessean newspaper and has more than 25 years’ experience as a reporter and editor in four states. She helped gather and compile the data that would form the basis for the AJC's 2022 \"Dangerous Dwellings\" series, which won an IRE Award given out by the group Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc. and won first place in its category in the National Headliner Awards. In 2019, she was part of an AJC team whose reporting on sexual harassment in Georgia state government prompted an overhaul of how the state deals with that issue. In 2015, she was a part of a combined AJC/WSB-TV team that was a finalist for the Tom Renner Award given out by the organization Investigative Reporters and Editors for the \"Over the Line\" series on police use of force. She is also the 2009 winner of the John Aubuchon Freedom of Information Award from the group Capitolbeat and the 2009 Open Doors Award from the Fort Worth Pro Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. Jennifer is a sixth-generation native Georgian. She grew up in Warrenton, Ga., a town of about 2,000 residents roughly an hour's drive west of Augusta. Her grandparents moved to Warrenton in 1952. Jennifer is interested in genealogy -- her father's family, the Peebleses and the Stranges, are from Emanuel County, and on her mother's side, she has roots in Greene, Morgan and Union counties. She welcomes contact with others who are researching the family lines.

She graduated from the University of Southern California within three years of admission, earning a bachelor’s in print journalism with a minor in business administration. Much of her work as a journalist in California, Texas and Georgia has focused on trying to unwind complex financial topics, including public pensions, conduit bonds, hospital finance and public construction projects. She has uncovered millions in misspent dollars and exposed shoddy decision-making that has resulted in financial nightmares. Her work has prompted changes in policies, removal of public officials and improvements in the lives of vulnerable people. She is a believer in the fundamental principles of American journalism and its duty to serve and foster an informed public.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/yamil.berard","twitter":"https://twitter.com/yberard","custom_ajc_phone":"817-715-1528","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2023-06-12T22:45:25.640Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/adf3f1e4-07ab-45a3-bf30-1673e114f32a.jpg","languages":"Fluent in Spanish, written and oral; strong grasp of French","location":"Atlanta","author_type":"Staff","custom_ajc_website":"ajc"}}},{"_id":"Eric-Fan","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Eric Fan","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/b74a6f7d-0d66-49b3-9ee4-2e49b88fd0ff.png","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Eric Fan is a data reporter and visualization developer at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

People often travel across county lines to get vaccinated, so the rates shown are informative but not absolute. For example, Miller County in southwest Georgia has a tiny population, but it has a hospital, a care center and a health department that received thousands of vaccine doses and probably administered many to residents of neighboring counties. The vaccines administered in Georgia so far include Pfizer’s and Moderna’s.

She has uncovered millions in misspent dollars and exposed shoddy decision-making that has resulted in financial nightmares. Her work has prompted changes in policies, removal of public officials and improvements in the lives of vulnerable people.

His work at the newspaper over the past 12 years has rooted out corruption and abuse, leading to changes in state law and federal investigations. In 2014, his reporting exposed how DeKalb County elected officials used their discretionary budgets for personal benefit, triggering an FBI investigation that resulted in criminal charges against a county commissioner and three other people. In 2016, he served on the team behind the AJC’s Doctors & Sex Abuse project, a Pulitzer finalist. Edwards led the newspaper’s 2019 coverage of the Georgia House speaker’s use of legislative leave to delay criminal cases for clients of his private law practice. He was part of the team behind the AJC's Dangerous Dwellings series on persistently dangerous apartment complexes, winner of 2022 national awards from both Investigative Reporters & Editors and the National Headliners Awards.

9, 2020 Atlanta: Voters had a long wait (some 2-3 hours) at the Park Tavern polling place located at 500 10th St NE, on Tuesday, June 9, 2020 in Atlanta. Many voters said they requested absentee ballots but never received them. Two lines, 300-yards long each formed parallel to Piedmont park in the parking lot as people patiently waited to vote. Over 1.2 million people had already voted before the polls opened on Tuesday, three-quarters of them with absentee-by-mail ballots, allowing them to avoid human contact at the polls. Voters will decide on many candidates, from president to county sheriff. The ballot also includes races for U.S. Senate, U.S. House and the Georgia General Assembly.

Jennifer is the former government editor of The (Nashville) Tennessean newspaper and has more than 25 years’ experience as a reporter and editor in four states. She helped gather and compile the data that would form the basis for the AJC's 2022 \"Dangerous Dwellings\" series, which won an IRE Award given out by the group Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc. and won first place in its category in the National Headliner Awards. In 2019, she was part of an AJC team whose reporting on sexual harassment in Georgia state government prompted an overhaul of how the state deals with that issue. In 2015, she was a part of a combined AJC/WSB-TV team that was a finalist for the Tom Renner Award given out by the organization Investigative Reporters and Editors for the \"Over the Line\" series on police use of force. She is also the 2009 winner of the John Aubuchon Freedom of Information Award from the group Capitolbeat and the 2009 Open Doors Award from the Fort Worth Pro Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. Jennifer is a sixth-generation native Georgian. She grew up in Warrenton, Ga., a town of about 2,000 residents roughly an hour's drive west of Augusta. Her grandparents moved to Warrenton in 1952. Jennifer is interested in genealogy -- her father's family, the Peebleses and the Stranges, are from Emanuel County, and on her mother's side, she has roots in Greene, Morgan and Union counties. She welcomes contact with others who are researching the family lines.

Jennifer is the former government editor of The (Nashville) Tennessean newspaper and has more than 25 years’ experience as a reporter and editor in four states. She helped gather and compile the data that would form the basis for the AJC's 2022 \"Dangerous Dwellings\" series, which won an IRE Award given out by the group Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc. and won first place in its category in the National Headliner Awards. In 2019, she was part of an AJC team whose reporting on sexual harassment in Georgia state government prompted an overhaul of how the state deals with that issue. In 2015, she was a part of a combined AJC/WSB-TV team that was a finalist for the Tom Renner Award given out by the organization Investigative Reporters and Editors for the \"Over the Line\" series on police use of force. She is also the 2009 winner of the John Aubuchon Freedom of Information Award from the group Capitolbeat and the 2009 Open Doors Award from the Fort Worth Pro Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. Jennifer is a sixth-generation native Georgian. She grew up in Warrenton, Ga., a town of about 2,000 residents roughly an hour's drive west of Augusta. Her grandparents moved to Warrenton in 1952. Jennifer is interested in genealogy -- her father's family, the Peebleses and the Stranges, are from Emanuel County, and on her mother's side, she has roots in Greene, Morgan and Union counties. She welcomes contact with others who are researching the family lines.

Jennifer is the former government editor of The (Nashville) Tennessean newspaper and has more than 25 years’ experience as a reporter and editor in four states. She helped gather and compile the data that would form the basis for the AJC's 2022 \"Dangerous Dwellings\" series, which won an IRE Award given out by the group Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc. and won first place in its category in the National Headliner Awards. In 2019, she was part of an AJC team whose reporting on sexual harassment in Georgia state government prompted an overhaul of how the state deals with that issue. In 2015, she was a part of a combined AJC/WSB-TV team that was a finalist for the Tom Renner Award given out by the organization Investigative Reporters and Editors for the \"Over the Line\" series on police use of force. She is also the 2009 winner of the John Aubuchon Freedom of Information Award from the group Capitolbeat and the 2009 Open Doors Award from the Fort Worth Pro Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. Jennifer is a sixth-generation native Georgian. She grew up in Warrenton, Ga., a town of about 2,000 residents roughly an hour's drive west of Augusta. Her grandparents moved to Warrenton in 1952. Jennifer is interested in genealogy -- her father's family, the Peebleses and the Stranges, are from Emanuel County, and on her mother's side, she has roots in Greene, Morgan and Union counties. She welcomes contact with others who are researching the family lines.

Jennifer is the former government editor of The (Nashville) Tennessean newspaper and has more than 25 years’ experience as a reporter and editor in four states. She helped gather and compile the data that would form the basis for the AJC's 2022 \"Dangerous Dwellings\" series, which won an IRE Award given out by the group Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc. and won first place in its category in the National Headliner Awards. In 2019, she was part of an AJC team whose reporting on sexual harassment in Georgia state government prompted an overhaul of how the state deals with that issue. In 2015, she was a part of a combined AJC/WSB-TV team that was a finalist for the Tom Renner Award given out by the organization Investigative Reporters and Editors for the \"Over the Line\" series on police use of force. She is also the 2009 winner of the John Aubuchon Freedom of Information Award from the group Capitolbeat and the 2009 Open Doors Award from the Fort Worth Pro Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. Jennifer is a sixth-generation native Georgian. She grew up in Warrenton, Ga., a town of about 2,000 residents roughly an hour's drive west of Augusta. Her grandparents moved to Warrenton in 1952. Jennifer is interested in genealogy -- her father's family, the Peebleses and the Stranges, are from Emanuel County, and on her mother's side, she has roots in Greene, Morgan and Union counties. She welcomes contact with others who are researching the family lines.

Jennifer is the former government editor of The (Nashville) Tennessean newspaper and has more than 25 years’ experience as a reporter and editor in four states. She helped gather and compile the data that would form the basis for the AJC's 2022 \"Dangerous Dwellings\" series, which won an IRE Award given out by the group Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc. and won first place in its category in the National Headliner Awards. In 2019, she was part of an AJC team whose reporting on sexual harassment in Georgia state government prompted an overhaul of how the state deals with that issue. In 2015, she was a part of a combined AJC/WSB-TV team that was a finalist for the Tom Renner Award given out by the organization Investigative Reporters and Editors for the \"Over the Line\" series on police use of force. She is also the 2009 winner of the John Aubuchon Freedom of Information Award from the group Capitolbeat and the 2009 Open Doors Award from the Fort Worth Pro Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. Jennifer is a sixth-generation native Georgian. She grew up in Warrenton, Ga., a town of about 2,000 residents roughly an hour's drive west of Augusta. Her grandparents moved to Warrenton in 1952. Jennifer is interested in genealogy -- her father's family, the Peebleses and the Stranges, are from Emanuel County, and on her mother's side, she has roots in Greene, Morgan and Union counties. She welcomes contact with others who are researching the family lines.

Based on infection-rate models, these maps predict how overwhelmed Georgia's ICUs might become even if hospitals could free up about half of the ICU beds that are typically occupied. Would freeing-up those ICU beds be enough to care for all the patients likely to become critically ill? The answer is often no, according to <a href=\"https://globalepidemics.org/2020/03/17/2020-03-17-caring-for-covid-19-patients/\" target=\"_blank\">models developed by Harvard University public health researchers</a>. These maps show that efforts to slow the infection rate – such as social distancing – help the ICUs from becoming so overwhelmed. Hospitals are responding to models like these by quickly increasing their overall beds and their ICU capacity across the state. It's also possible that the models may overstate how many Georgians will need critical care or hospitalization.

By combining companies together using the addresses and names they listed on their real estate purchases, the AJC also uncovered landlords that had far higher-than-average eviction rates at their properties.</p>\n<p>Below is a map showing multifamily properties in metro Atlanta with 50 or more units and their eviction filing rates. The larger the circle, the more eviction filings the property had per unit listed with the county tax assessor’s office. Click on a property to get information on the building, including any limited liability companies (LLCs) that owned it in 2016.</p>\n<p>The map also contains demographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2015 five-year American Community Survey. Use the demographic filters to change the variables displayed on the underlying map to see their relationship to the eviction filing rates of multifamily properties.</p>\n<p>We will update the database regularly as we continue our investigation into evictions in metro Atlanta.</p>\n<p>Note: Some properties include multiple parcels. In those instances, building locations and owner information represent that of the parcel with the most habitable units, according to county tax assessment data.</p>\n<p class=\"text-muted\">Data collection and analysis by <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/jeff-ernsthausen/aMouE5hiOg8c3ZVsgRq5XO/\">Jeff Ernsthausen</a><br/>Map presentation by <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/online/contacts/emily-merwin/w6qJP2sSU2QWUghc8Jap6H/\">Emily Merwin DiRico</a><br/>\n  Jacquelyn Elias contributed to data analysis and verification</p>\n<div id=\"mapiframe\"></div>\n<script src=\"https://pym.nprapps.org/pym.v1.min.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"><\/script>\n<script>\n    var pymParent = new pym.Parent('mapiframe', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/ajcnewsapps/2018/evictions-graphics/unit-map/index.html', {});\n<\/script>","type":"raw_html"}],"first_publish_date":"2018-08-07T21:35:06Z","related_content":{"basic":[],"redirect":[]},"teaseImageObject":{"_id":"3Q66SGAP2KT2HWWK7CFR4BWADY","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/Vyeway-oFQys28lm7_d4oQmD5TM=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/3Q66SGAP2KT2HWWK7CFR4BWADY.jpg","galleries":[],"keywords":["atlanta apartments","Real Estate","Clayton County","Cobb County","DeKalb County","Gwinnett County","North Fulton","Fulton County","Buckhead","Atlanta Beltline","story-tpt-id:8323","story-tpt-id:8334","story-tpt-id:8336","story-tpt-id:8338"],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"https://www.ajc.com//rw/Pub/p9/AJC/2018/06/21/Images/eviction-filings-map-preview-new_20180621173618.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/3Q66SGAP2KT2HWWK7CFR4BWADY.jpg","proxyUrl":"/resizer/Vyeway-oFQys28lm7_d4oQmD5TM=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/3Q66SGAP2KT2HWWK7CFR4BWADY.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/Vyeway-oFQys28lm7_d4oQmD5TM=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/3Q66SGAP2KT2HWWK7CFR4BWADY.jpg","restricted":false,"takenOn":"2018-06-21T21:36:52Z","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/ZFLd5NNR2jtZgWLjRMWXsfVCiiQ=/300x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/3Q66SGAP2KT2HWWK7CFR4BWADY.jpg","version":2},"address":{},"auth":{"1":"ba6ea25979cf19e11f34641d3175eef0b38272764d5c65d18e636f6193ce95ae"},"caption":"Explore the data","created_date":"2020-06-29T00:02:35Z","credits":{"by":[{"_id":"emily-merwin-dirico","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Emily DiRico","org":"Atlanta","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/9cbfa7f8-14f4-4454-aca3-8d1c6c8654df.jpg","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Emily Merwin DiRico has been doing information design and news application development at the AJC since she arrived as a summer intern in 2009.
