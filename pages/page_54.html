I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"New doc spotlights former WNBA player as social activist, Atlanta Dream owner"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-16T10:00:00.847Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-16T10:00:00.847Z","_id":"Z2GCFKJCCREQLMTXZUPJXFLAC4","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"0819a3385fcc791103d5dcd8740d34f9487ffb08a85fe05ed902c80c97651e2f"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"ROKU","type":"author","byline":"ROKU"}]},"subtitle":"Renee Montgomery","width":6240,"caption":"Renee Montgomery, the former WNBA player, became an unexpected owner of the Atlanta Dream after a conflict between the players and owner Kelly Loeffler.

My love for sports writing started back during the pandemic, which challenged me to think outside the box with sports and athletes. Later in my college experience I was introduced to broadcast and began covering San Diego State (SDSU) games on social media. I was the host of the sports podcast, as well as their social media. I enjoy what sports can do for communities and its people.

My love for sports writing started back during the pandemic, which challenged me to think outside the box with sports and athletes. Later in my college experience I was introduced to broadcast and began covering San Diego State (SDSU) games on social media. I was the host of the sports podcast, as well as their social media. I enjoy what sports can do for communities and its people.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

My love for sports writing started back during the pandemic, which challenged me to think outside the box with sports and athletes. Later in my college experience I was introduced to broadcast and began covering San Diego State (SDSU) games on social media. I was the host of the sports podcast, as well as their social media. I enjoy what sports can do for communities and its people.

My love for sports writing started back during the pandemic, which challenged me to think outside the box with sports and athletes. Later in my college experience I was introduced to broadcast and began covering San Diego State (SDSU) games on social media. I was the host of the sports podcast, as well as their social media. I enjoy what sports can do for communities and its people.
