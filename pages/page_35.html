Prabhu joined The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2017 to cover Georgia government and politics. Her reporting focuses on gambling and abortion legislation, criminal justice and social issues and legislative races. Born in Queens, N.Y., and raised in northern Virginia, Maya received her bachelor’s degree from Spelman College before heading back to the D.C. area to get a master’s from the University of Maryland. Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol. And, as anyone who follows her on Twitter would know, Maya loves a good awards show and, an avid member of the Beyhive, has near-encyclopedic knowledge of all things Beyoncé.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MayaTPrabhu/","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Maya","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5823","middleName":"T.","_id":"maya-t-prabhu","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/maya-t-prabhu/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"New Harris ad features family of Georgia woman who died from abortion-related complications"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-16T12:00:02.389Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-16T12:58:03.591Z","_id":"DCINLAZS3FF3LM5FEJ6RTCYIPQ","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"f0cd65521e7e8ee96cca3102ddf8a09efe30ce7ccfea6785fb44189c616d51c5"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"Facebook","type":"author","byline":"Facebook"}]},"subtitle":"Amber Thurman","width":1600,"caption":"The family of Amber Nicole Thurman, who died in 2022 after she couldn't access a legal abortion and timely medical care, appears in a new campaign ad for Vice President Kamala Harris.

Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol.

Prabhu joined The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2017 to cover Georgia government and politics. Her reporting focuses on gambling and abortion legislation, criminal justice and social issues and legislative races. Born in Queens, N.Y., and raised in northern Virginia, Maya received her bachelor’s degree from Spelman College before heading back to the D.C. area to get a master’s from the University of Maryland. Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol. And, as anyone who follows her on Twitter would know, Maya loves a good awards show and, an avid member of the Beyhive, has near-encyclopedic knowledge of all things Beyoncé.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MayaTPrabhu/","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Maya","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5823","middleName":"T.","_id":"maya-t-prabhu","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/maya-t-prabhu/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Georgia Supreme Court reinstates near-ban on abortions"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-07T16:57:54.567Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-07T20:53:06.635Z","_id":"P5GQJSNREVB2PILWJPBEL37VNU","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"7efe39af119c345cb01c29d022d99bec7be5a8798d5e2669d0d84c96242ec709"},"credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"Miguel Martinez/AJC","type":"author"}],"by":[{"name":"Miguel Martinez","type":"author"}]},"subtitle":"Abortion appeal\r ","width":6000,"caption":"Solicitor General Stephen Petrany speaks during the oral arguments for the challenge to Georgia's abortion law at the Georgia Supreme Court in March 2023.

Prabhu joined The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2017 to cover Georgia government and politics. Her reporting focuses on gambling and abortion legislation, criminal justice and social issues and legislative races. Born in Queens, N.Y., and raised in northern Virginia, Maya received her bachelor’s degree from Spelman College before heading back to the D.C. area to get a master’s from the University of Maryland. Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta.

Prabhu joined The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2017 to cover Georgia government and politics. Her reporting focuses on gambling and abortion legislation, criminal justice and social issues and legislative races. Born in Queens, N.Y., and raised in northern Virginia, Maya received her bachelor’s degree from Spelman College before heading back to the D.C. area to get a master’s from the University of Maryland. Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol. And, as anyone who follows her on Twitter would know, Maya loves a good awards show and, an avid member of the Beyhive, has near-encyclopedic knowledge of all things Beyoncé.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MayaTPrabhu/","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Maya","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5823","middleName":"T.","_id":"maya-t-prabhu","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/maya-t-prabhu/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Georgia’s attorney general is asking the state Supreme Court to reinstate the abortion ban"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-03T14:22:05.805Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-04T00:13:23.995Z","_id":"VQQCFWNJJ5ESJMADGOH3VOH54U","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"860e173753092c5729b3f0e81767c61818d413d4c9b660acd769627e22587ba1"},"credits":{},"subtitle":"Training Center Indictment","width":3744,"caption":"Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr speaks during a press conference to discuss the recent indictment of 61 defendants in Fulton County at  the Georgia Department of Public Safety Tuesday, Sep. 5, 2023 (Natrice Miller/natrice.miller@ajc.com)","type":"image","distributor":{"mode":"custom","name":"AJC Freelancer","category":"wires"},"url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/LN3BHJH7PK5CIZZFXMIYH3LK2Q.JPG","height":2496,"resized_obj":{"src":"https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/LN3BHJH7PK5CIZZFXMIYH3LK2Q.JPG?auth=860e173753092c5729b3f0e81767c61818d413d4c9b660acd769627e22587ba1&width=330&height=330&smart=true"}}}],"expires":1729092356723,"lastModified":1729092235822},"{\"arcSite\":\"ajc\",\"daysBack\":300,\"displayClass\":\"Slider\",\"displayClassesRequiringImg\":[\"Slider\",\"Slider - Special Features\"],\"from\":1,\"includeContentTypes\":\"gallery\",\"includeSections\":\"/politics\",\"primarySize\":[[150,150]],\"size\":10}":{"data":[{"content_elements":[{"owner":{"id":"ajc"},"copyright":"2024 Atlanta Journal Constitution","address":{"region":"Georgia"},"auth":{"1":"502183cd76fa07cebe374a7f693313fe88ba8c04900fad8e6a679ef8d65b046c"},"caption":"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump points at the media after speaking at his campaign rally at Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre in Cobb County on Tuesday, October 15, 2024.

Prabhu joined The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2017 to cover Georgia government and politics. Her reporting focuses on gambling and abortion legislation, criminal justice and social issues and legislative races. Born in Queens, N.Y., and raised in northern Virginia, Maya received her bachelor’s degree from Spelman College before heading back to the D.C. area to get a master’s from the University of Maryland. Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol. And, as anyone who follows her on Twitter would know, Maya loves a good awards show and, an avid member of the Beyhive, has near-encyclopedic knowledge of all things Beyoncé.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MayaTPrabhu/","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Maya","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5823","middleName":"T.","_id":"maya-t-prabhu","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/maya-t-prabhu/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"New Harris ad features family of Georgia woman who died from abortion-related complications"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-16T12:00:02.389Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-16T12:58:03.591Z","_id":"DCINLAZS3FF3LM5FEJ6RTCYIPQ","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"f0cd65521e7e8ee96cca3102ddf8a09efe30ce7ccfea6785fb44189c616d51c5"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"Facebook","type":"author","byline":"Facebook"}]},"subtitle":"Amber Thurman","width":1600,"caption":"The family of Amber Nicole Thurman, who died in 2022 after she couldn't access a legal abortion and timely medical care, appears in a new campaign ad for Vice President Kamala Harris.

Prabhu joined The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2017 to cover Georgia government and politics. Her reporting focuses on gambling and abortion legislation, criminal justice and social issues and legislative races. Born in Queens, N.Y., and raised in northern Virginia, Maya received her bachelor’s degree from Spelman College before heading back to the D.C. area to get a master’s from the University of Maryland. Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol. And, as anyone who follows her on Twitter would know, Maya loves a good awards show and, an avid member of the Beyhive, has near-encyclopedic knowledge of all things Beyoncé.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MayaTPrabhu/","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Maya","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5823","middleName":"T.","_id":"maya-t-prabhu","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/maya-t-prabhu/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Abortions in Georgia continue to decline in post-Roe world"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-15T09:00:01.027Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-15T09:00:01.027Z","_id":"QJ4GFJL3P5CPTBINVWTIUY6PKQ","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"64f83e7ff05ff889bdb7de1ada7534f096ea4cbd5677007c3c18cbbf363e849c"},"credits":{"by":[]},"subtitle":"Dobb's Anniversary","width":3744,"caption":"An ultrasonographer at Atlanta Morning Center logs into to her workspace on Thursday, June 15, 2023.

Prabhu joined The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2017 to cover Georgia government and politics. Her reporting focuses on gambling and abortion legislation, criminal justice and social issues and legislative races. Born in Queens, N.Y., and raised in northern Virginia, Maya received her bachelor’s degree from Spelman College before heading back to the D.C. area to get a master’s from the University of Maryland. Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol. And, as anyone who follows her on Twitter would know, Maya loves a good awards show and, an avid member of the Beyhive, has near-encyclopedic knowledge of all things Beyoncé.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MayaTPrabhu/","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Maya","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5823","middleName":"T.","_id":"maya-t-prabhu","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/maya-t-prabhu/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"‘Our patients deserve better’: Clinics grapple with uncertainty in Georgia’s abortion law"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-09T19:05:16.675Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-10T15:53:22.402Z","_id":"Z43IXWADYJEZTHYC2JRXW2D5XU","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"a6d62cf7004c4e125d67fd123179bbc64b7393db1b5475f8765bf1ff5173054c"},"credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"Steve Schaefer","type":"author"}],"by":[{"name":"Steve Schaefer","type":"author"}]},"subtitle":"Protesters gather outside of the Women's Health Center.

Prabhu joined The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2017 to cover Georgia government and politics. Her reporting focuses on gambling and abortion legislation, criminal justice and social issues and legislative races. Born in Queens, N.Y., and raised in northern Virginia, Maya received her bachelor’s degree from Spelman College before heading back to the D.C. area to get a master’s from the University of Maryland. Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics.

Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol. And, as anyone who follows her on Twitter would know, Maya loves a good awards show and, an avid member of the Beyhive, has near-encyclopedic knowledge of all things Beyoncé.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MayaTPrabhu/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/MayaTPrabhu","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/mayatprabhu/","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5823","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[{"name":"Spelman College"},{"name":"University of Maryland"}],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2024-04-30T18:35:31.117Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/dd4ce7a7-fbf2-4f45-8fb2-296165ee1f32.png","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayatprabhu/","author_type":"Staff","type":"author","bio_page":"/staff/maya-t-prabhu/","expertise":"11","custom_ajc_website":"ajc","middleName":"T."}}}]},"description":{"basic":"Reporter Maya Prabhu keeps close watch on the Georgia Legislature, writing mostly about weighty issues of governing.

Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol. And, as anyone who follows her on Twitter would know, Maya loves a good awards show and, an avid member of the Beyhive, has near-encyclopedic knowledge of all things Beyoncé.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MayaTPrabhu/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/MayaTPrabhu","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/mayatprabhu/","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5823","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[{"name":"Spelman College"},{"name":"University of Maryland"}],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2024-04-30T18:35:31.117Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/dd4ce7a7-fbf2-4f45-8fb2-296165ee1f32.png","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayatprabhu/","author_type":"Staff","type":"author","bio_page":"/staff/maya-t-prabhu/","expertise":"11","custom_ajc_website":"ajc","middleName":"T."}}},{"_id":"mark-niesse","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Mark Niesse","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/e427ab70-e29b-4476-84fc-ce2b7d6cbeda.png","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Mark Niesse covers voting rights and elections for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
