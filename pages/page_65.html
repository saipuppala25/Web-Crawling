I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"One Musicfest moves from Piedmont Park to smaller Atlanta venue"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-02T14:37:11.926Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-02T18:28:24.419Z","_id":"RAPBYQQA3RG6LO6YQEHONK42SI","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"c618433227b0a5edcdf3764cf33267ad9c16af778c93ea8b83f0e312d26de194"},"credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"arvin.temkar@ajc.com","type":"author"}],"by":[{"name":"Arvin Temkar","type":"author"}]},"subtitle":"Day 2 of ONE Musicfest to bring big crowds to see big acts\r","width":3300,"caption":"Crowds are seen at ONE Musicfest at Piedmont Park in Atlanta on Sunday, October 29, 2023.

He cut his teeth in sports journalism as a breaking news writer within the mixed martial arts industry — all after earning a bachelor's degree in journalism and a bachelor's degree in English from Georgia State University.\n\nHe dedicated the following years of his career to working as a digital content producer for Cox Media Group, writing stories and crafting breaking news within the multiple-time Edward Murrow Award winning 95.5 WSB-Radio newsroom.\n\nMoving from radio to television, the next chapter of his career featured a digital producer position at WXIA-11Alive, one of Atlanta's top television news stations within the nation's top sixth market. Throughout his career, Hunter has gone on to write sports, entertainment, political and local breaking news for a variety of outlets.\n\nA nerd at heart, Hunter usually has a video game controller in his hands when he's not working. When not leveling up in the latest game, he's usually searching for new records to listen to or obsessing over Dungeons and Dragons.","fuzzy_match":false,"author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Hunter","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"_id":"hunter-boyce","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/hunter-boyce/","slug":""}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Decade of silence: Science behind James Earl Jones’ life with stuttering"},"first_publish_date":"2024-09-11T13:48:19.865Z","last_updated_date":"2024-09-11T13:48:19.981Z","_id":"6GMU4GS5YZDF5ME2FJWXLXY2JE","teaseImageObject":{"credits":{},"width":1920,"type":"image","url":"https://d1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net/09-10-2024/t_76137720edbc4b24a6e3c60e716a3a5e_name_a9b7eb1557cc4cbf9ad3161d6b977d3d_scaled.jpg","height":1080,"resized_obj":{"src":"https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F09-10-2024%2Ft_76137720edbc4b24a6e3c60e716a3a5e_name_a9b7eb1557cc4cbf9ad3161d6b977d3d_scaled.jpg?auth=507992d1dafa147751149e68dc0e608aed139daf0d2fabed54bf86e69100cab2&width=330&height=330&smart=true"}}},{"content_elements":[{"_id":"V7VQBD7UWVHGXOVIB5HGXNMPNE","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725981131341},"type":"text","content":"On Monday, the Atlanta Police Department<a href=\"https://www.atlantapd.org/Home/Components/News/News/6073/71\" target=\"_blank\"> published more details </a>related to Rich Homie Quan’s death."},{"_id":"6JFPUKKTRBCAJHOZN5QPBBMY4Y","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725987682337},"type":"text","content":"The rapper, Dequantes Devontay Lamar, <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/obituaries/atlanta-rapper-rich-homie-quan-dies-at-34/BJRABI4FJFH7ZMEBWUQ337VVBM/\" target=\"_blank\">died Thursday</a> after being found unresponsive by his girlfriend at their southwest Atlanta home.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Kevin Hart believes he gave the performance of his career in ‘Fight Night’ "},"first_publish_date":"2024-09-06T21:51:47.95Z","last_updated_date":"2024-09-06T21:51:48.085Z","_id":"YKW4CCJTMBG6FGJUA27CVS3XBE","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"d2dd6252ef7d41f5b3fd9d6d1050fb9dea27856e93f745fa4e90ee0f460a96e4"},"credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"TNS","type":"author"}],"by":[{"name":"Eli Joshua AdÈ/PEACOCK","type":"author"}]},"subtitle":"ENTER-VID-FIGHT-NIGHT-REVIEW-MCT","width":3000,"caption":"Kevin Hart stars as Gordon “Chicken Man” Williams in Peacock’s “Fight Night: The Million Dollar Heist.\" (Eli Joshua Adé/Peacock/TNS)","taxonomy":{"tags":[{"slug":"McClatchy-Tribune"}]},"type":"image","distributor":{"mode":"custom","name":"McClatchy Tribune","category":"wires"},"url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/CZD3AICXPRGHYHLZL3CSWEG3GM.jpg","height":2001,"resized_obj":{"src":"https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/CZD3AICXPRGHYHLZL3CSWEG3GM.jpg?auth=d2dd6252ef7d41f5b3fd9d6d1050fb9dea27856e93f745fa4e90ee0f460a96e4&width=330&height=330&smart=true"}}},{"content_elements":[{"_id":"VRHBX3LYZNB3RLA7ITTGCFAOYA","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725545643801},"type":"text","content":"Hot 107.9 has convinced Fly Guy DC to come back to radio after he left Streetz 94.5 last year."},{"_id":"2BRQMKLBRFFI5ICYHWYW4WFZUU","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725569500728},"type":"text","content":"Fly Guy DC, whose real name is Audley Feemster Jr., this week began co-hosting the 7 p.m. to midnight shift with MiAsia Symone, a fellow Streetz alum who has been at Hot for 21 months as on-air talent, board operator and digital content creator."},{"_id":"Z5RWBZ66BRFFBK3KNQMYOJ2S7I","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725592845628},"type":"text","content":"The Atlanta-based syndicated show “Incognito’s Posted on the Corner,” which had been taking the night slot, moves to afternoons, replacing J Nicks.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Fly Guy DC, MiAsia Symone reunite for new night show at Hot 107.9"},"first_publish_date":"2024-09-06T15:22:40.49Z","last_updated_date":"2024-09-06T15:22:40.625Z","_id":"5UJPKXS3MRH3DLCBOZGGZ22TIY","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"0a33b1bdc1fdb90a98982985b2cc74d2a1d87b1e16f4eca2f522409365665104"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"RODNEY HO/rho@ajc","type":"author","byline":"RODNEY HO/rho@ajc"}]},"subtitle":"MiAsia Symone Fly Guy DC","width":2048,"caption":"MiAsia Symone and Fly Guy DC are the new night show on Hot 107.9.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Zoë Kravitz gives #MeToo spin in Channing Tatum thriller ‘Blink Twice’ "},"first_publish_date":"2024-08-22T12:00:02.306Z","last_updated_date":"2024-08-22T14:02:45.227Z","_id":"WMOCX3CIANEYXG6C5NK4AALGBU","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"0467211ddfd76311d4f00af1f475cbc7d61d8a3e2fc467a8ab1f3b332bf3abbe"},"credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"Carlos Somonte","type":"author"}],"by":[{"name":"Carlos Somonte","type":"author","byline":"Carlos Somonte"}]},"subtitle":"Channing Tatum Zoe Kravitz","width":4500,"caption":"Actor Channing Tatum and director Zoë Kravitz on the set of their film \"Blink Twice,\" in theaters Aug. 23. \nPhoto credit: Carlos Somonte\n© 2024 Amazon Content Services LLC.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"The Roots cancel Chastain Atlanta date 10 days before scheduled concert"},"first_publish_date":"2024-08-20T21:14:39.129Z","last_updated_date":"2024-08-22T19:44:27.033Z","_id":"VSB5BCBI5JEVVPEVVG4Y6SHWRQ","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"d9cfa97b3f4c262f41711c0652c30122928aa405023535780c5377ee33ffe958"},"credits":{},"subtitle":"The F.O.R.C.E Hip Hop tour","width":3744,"caption":"Questlove of The Roots performs in Atlanta during The F.O.R.C.E Tour starring LL Cool J at State Farm Arena on Monday, August 21, 2023.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004.
