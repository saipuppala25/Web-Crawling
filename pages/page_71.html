I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"David Cross, now 60, doesn’t mind being an older dad with a 7-year-old"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-12T11:00:00.888Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-14T13:06:37.08Z","_id":"AQUWM7ZHCNHVBK47PTC6TUUCTE","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"f706fc434a54b4a610fb70bc9cef7ec5518c2f7b123771407dba9133e7fadbbd"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"CONTRIBUTED'","type":"author","byline":"CONTRIBUTED'"}]},"subtitle":"David Cross","width":2560,"caption":"David Cross, who is touring all around North America in the fall of 2024, is coming to the Tabernacle Oct. 16, 2024.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Heather McMahan embraces timing of ‘Call Her Daddy’ podcast appearance"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-11T19:05:30.105Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-14T14:45:19.431Z","_id":"3KGXINWJXFAULJWREVB5QC2XJY","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"dbfb6e661d9f8e91edf85fbf168bfe38c6eaa3851459cdebb88fc94c39dc4838"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"HULU","type":"author","byline":"HULU"}]},"subtitle":"Heather McMahan","width":6000,"caption":"Heather McMahan at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta last year for a new special that is airing on Hulu called \"Breadwinner.\" HULU","type":"image","distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"8aec2b8c-455c-4816-903d-79fc8fdf8019"},"url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/OK75YUJFDBFSNN7P6IGG3Z2PAM.JPG","height":4000,"resized_obj":{"src":"https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/OK75YUJFDBFSNN7P6IGG3Z2PAM.JPG?auth=dbfb6e661d9f8e91edf85fbf168bfe38c6eaa3851459cdebb88fc94c39dc4838&width=220&height=220&smart=true"}}},{"content_elements":[{"_id":"MFTNNDASUVCY7P27H36TGVGLZU","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1721664677994},"type":"text","content":"You probably haven’t seen anything like a <a href=\"https://www.suryaensemble.com/#home\" target=\"_blank\">Surya Ensemble</a> performance, but you should."},{"_id":"YV2CGIDUZBA2ROFLX7V5HC7SNY","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1728338729659},"type":"text","content":"The group’s music is bold and brash, the performances sexy and often soulful.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Colin Hay wishes original Men at Work band could have stayed together longer"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-10T14:00:01.122Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-10T15:39:15.597Z","_id":"IQUAMLZOVNF7ZLYGHGOQW2KJHQ","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"d83560df5982eb365d9f86106896b2b95b1f71991cddfddf6d4b54e3392e245e"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"CONTRIBUTED","type":"author","byline":"CONTRIBUTED"}]},"subtitle":"Men at Work","width":7061,"caption":"Men at Work is performing at the Fred in Peachtree City on Oct. 12, 2024.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"On the set of NBC’s Atlanta-filmed ‘Found,’ where Shanola Hampton reigns"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-09T20:11:40.174Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-09T21:14:41.479Z","_id":"TCPBDRXZCJF4RLG55RWD7M6AII","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"6ed5a5c6b32e7275c8edbe0bc328a6e39dcc599971350d63f578e4ae6f538b64"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"RODNEY HO/rho@aj.","type":"author","byline":"RODNEY HO/rho@aj."}]},"subtitle":"Shanola Hampton","width":1800,"caption":"Shanola Hampton stars in NBC's \"Found.\" She is shooting season 2 in Atlanta and gives Access Hollywood a tour of the set on July 25, 2024.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Zoo Atlanta prepares for life without pandas"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-07T15:58:01.829Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-07T20:53:06.147Z","_id":"SWPY2XZDSZH7RJTJCGL4LQEUQY","firstInlineImage":{"owner":{"id":"ajc"},"copyright":"Jenni Girtman","address":{},"auth":{"1":"ace35999bff815b8462fa17b5d841f6382087f3c2f633e83d848471a2dc2dfcf"},"caption":"Lun Lun rolls around between naps during Zoo Atlanta’s Farewell Visit with the giant pandas Saturday, Oct 5, 2024.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Michael Stipe holds his first art show in Atlanta at Jackson Fine Art"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-05T22:00:20.602Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-09T18:10:00.865Z","_id":"Z7LMATWJ5ZBQDHL6PEO7G2JXSM","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"db4edb8605f0e89aaffe38afc090daa76d05fadb3b8b8a20a9515911e09a1ce1"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"ROP","type":"author","byline":"ROP"}]},"subtitle":"Michael Stipe","width":2048,"caption":"Michael Stipe, lead singer of R.E.M., has an art exhibit \"Even the birds gave pause\" at Jackson Fine Art in Buckhead and appeared at an opening party Oct. 1 and met patrons.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Sister Hazel has become a popular draw at free metro Atlanta festivals"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-04T10:00:01.107Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-04T13:34:59.507Z","_id":"3IDJ3HZYWJBWJMK7AY6LQQ2J2M","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"b376c62080f65dafe9c5d2d10991dfd1e75bb986fbae573dcba48d789ca81d52"},"credits":{"by":[{"name":"Brian Hall","type":"author","byline":"Brian Hall","slug":"brian-hall"}]},"subtitle":"Sister Hazel","width":524,"caption":"Sister Hazel has performed in several free music festivals in Atlanta in recent years.","type":"image","distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"8aec2b8c-455c-4816-903d-79fc8fdf8019"},"url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/TT7KZOF2M4J5PPKN3AODAAD3UE.jpg","height":395,"resized_obj":{"src":"https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/TT7KZOF2M4J5PPKN3AODAAD3UE.jpg?auth=b376c62080f65dafe9c5d2d10991dfd1e75bb986fbae573dcba48d789ca81d52&width=330&height=330&smart=true"}}},{"content_elements":[{"_id":"V7VQBD7UWVHGXOVIB5HGXNMPNE","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[]},"type":"text","content":"One Musicfest will no longer be held in Piedmont Park this year, according to a social media post from the festival Wednesday morning."},{"_id":"SNPVX2IYWRHNFEARXT3UO6WVQA","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[]},"type":"text","content":"Instead, the two-day event (which takes place Oct. 26 and 27) is relocating to Central Park in Old Fourth Ward — a smaller space compared to Piedmont Park.

I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004.

In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"T.I., Sexyy Red, T-Pain headline 96.1 The Beat Jingle Ball 2024"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-01T12:41:09.756Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-01T12:41:09.888Z","_id":"Y4WVGPEUUZC2RJN43IETOISVG4","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"b8f4bdd3d5b4ad94c8e13255451518eabbb43da6834828a73d2c0298929dc065"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"Kymani Culmer","type":"author","byline":"Kymani Culmer"}]},"subtitle":"winterfest 2023","width":6240,"caption":"T.I. performs Friday, Dec. 15, 2023 at State Farm Arena for V103’s Winterfest.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Sheena Easton concert date in Sandy Springs canceled at last second"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-01T13:27:58.035Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-01T17:47:23.009Z","_id":"O2SLQHDHT5GEHHJ2WH2OWHWVHE","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"a5bfe3b66980cfa16f94345371a52519c775ca65c3d5bda33f1af279b6f80404"},"credits":{"by":[{"name":"CONTRIBUTED","type":"author","byline":"CONTRIBUTED"}]},"subtitle":"Sheena Easton","width":1800,"caption":"Sheena Easton, who had 7 top 10 hits in the 1980s, will be performing at Byers Theatre in Sandy Springs Oct. 6, 2024.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Sheena Easton concert date in Sandy Springs canceled at last second"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-01T13:27:58.035Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-01T17:47:23.009Z","_id":"O2SLQHDHT5GEHHJ2WH2OWHWVHE","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"a5bfe3b66980cfa16f94345371a52519c775ca65c3d5bda33f1af279b6f80404"},"credits":{"by":[{"name":"CONTRIBUTED","type":"author","byline":"CONTRIBUTED"}]},"subtitle":"Sheena Easton","width":1800,"caption":"Sheena Easton, who had 7 top 10 hits in the 1980s, will be performing at Byers Theatre in Sandy Springs Oct. 6, 2024.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Cody Walker honors late brother Paul with FuelFest at Atlanta Motor Speedway"},"first_publish_date":"2024-09-30T10:00:00.581Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-01T14:55:06.27Z","_id":"2WRDJT2VKRDHFFWQA7UUHFQF6M","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"ba357107c5e6d83f701e56bd8195aba3429ad0a2070e2a65755c0dfe8dccc1a5"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"CONTRIBUTED","type":"author","byline":"CONTRIBUTED"}]},"subtitle":"Tyrese Gibson Cody Walker","width":1800,"caption":"Tyrese Gibson and Cody Walker will be at FuelFest Oct. 19, 2024 at Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Fox Weather meteorologist Bob Van Dillen saves woman from flooding car"},"first_publish_date":"2024-09-27T15:06:38.094Z","last_updated_date":"2024-09-27T15:09:07.335Z","_id":"KLMJGTYG3FAKHFKKTJDCTWNVBY","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"afb02f69b8442c5daef1976b25b9217893ccb64a16cba2e9a3b2e581f0651090"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"FOX WEATHER","type":"author","byline":"FOX WEATHER"}]},"subtitle":"Bob Van Dillen","width":4032,"caption":"Fox Weather meteorologist Bob Van Dillen saved a woman in Buckhead Friday morning from her submerged car.

I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004.

I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"V-103 Winterfest features Bell Biv DeVoe, Xscape, Q Parker of 112"},"first_publish_date":"2024-09-24T15:24:57.006Z","last_updated_date":"2024-09-24T15:24:57.093Z","_id":"4NEMYLYJ5BDPDLE4JR6UVPOWCI","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"37e461ae25c665d3a0de8c3e7215692a5db3b9e894c0f37450a5505455e46f00"},"credits":{"by":[{"name":"Robb Cohen for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution","type":"author"}]},"subtitle":"holiday","width":1500,"caption":"Xscape appeared at the Atlanta R&B Music Experience-Holiday Edition on December 4, 2022, at State Farm Arena.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ajcrodneyho","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[{"name":"Oyster Bay High School, 1987"},{"name":"Princeton University, B.A., political economics, 1991"},{"name":"George State University Robinson School, MBA marketig, 2007"}],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2024-08-03T14:43:47.124Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/e75580df-c242-40ff-b2b4-9809bdbda069.jpg","expertise":"2, Film, TV, radio, comedy, things to do around town, business","beat":"Entertatinment","author_type":"Staff","type":"author","bio_page":"/staff/rodney-ho/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/rodneyhoajc/","custom_ajc_website":"ajc"}}}]},"description":{"basic":"David Cross, who grew up in Roswell, loves being an older dad at age 60 to a seven year old with his wife and actress Amber Tamlyn."},"display_date":"2024-10-12T11:00:00Z","distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"8aec2b8c-455c-4816-903d-79fc8fdf8019"},"headlines":{"basic":"David Cross, now 60, doesn’t mind being an older dad with a 7-year-old","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"label":{"team":{"display":true,"text":"features","url":""}},"language":"","owner":{"sponsored":false},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"EFVN5TNAUNBZJMZX3MBGCXEB3U","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/aF-pJ6GtoU_VYj1b_3TqyFh9rok=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/EFVN5TNAUNBZJMZX3MBGCXEB3U.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","keywords":[],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"David Cross Worst Daddy in the World.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/EFVN5TNAUNBZJMZX3MBGCXEB3U.jpg","owner":"rodney.ho@ajc.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/aF-pJ6GtoU_VYj1b_3TqyFh9rok=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/EFVN5TNAUNBZJMZX3MBGCXEB3U.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/aF-pJ6GtoU_VYj1b_3TqyFh9rok=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/EFVN5TNAUNBZJMZX3MBGCXEB3U.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/f_ppTPzjMZVTiXN1BlJaYVit2tk=/300x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/EFVN5TNAUNBZJMZX3MBGCXEB3U.jpg","version":0,"template_id":594},"address":{},"auth":{"1":"f706fc434a54b4a610fb70bc9cef7ec5518c2f7b123771407dba9133e7fadbbd"},"caption":"David Cross, who is touring all around North America in the fall of 2024, is coming to the Tabernacle Oct. 16, 2024.
