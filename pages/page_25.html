Prabhu joined The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2017 to cover Georgia government and politics. Her reporting focuses on gambling and abortion legislation, criminal justice and social issues and legislative races. Born in Queens, N.Y., and raised in northern Virginia, Maya received her bachelor’s degree from Spelman College before heading back to the D.C. area to get a master’s from the University of Maryland. Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol. And, as anyone who follows her on Twitter would know, Maya loves a good awards show and, an avid member of the Beyhive, has near-encyclopedic knowledge of all things Beyoncé.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MayaTPrabhu/","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Maya","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5823","middleName":"T.","_id":"maya-t-prabhu","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/maya-t-prabhu/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"New Harris ad features family of Georgia woman who died from abortion-related complications"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-16T12:00:02.389Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-16T12:58:03.591Z","_id":"DCINLAZS3FF3LM5FEJ6RTCYIPQ","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"f0cd65521e7e8ee96cca3102ddf8a09efe30ce7ccfea6785fb44189c616d51c5"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"Facebook","type":"author","byline":"Facebook"}]},"subtitle":"Amber Thurman","width":1600,"caption":"The family of Amber Nicole Thurman, who died in 2022 after she couldn't access a legal abortion and timely medical care, appears in a new campaign ad for Vice President Kamala Harris.

I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.
