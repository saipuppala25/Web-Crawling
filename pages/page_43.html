Her reporting focuses on gambling and abortion legislation, criminal justice and social issues and legislative races.

Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta. Maya also moved around a lot as a kid and an adult, enabling her to live in seven of the states represented by flags flying at Liberty Plaza at the Capitol. And, as anyone who follows her on Twitter would know, Maya loves a good awards show and, an avid member of the Beyhive, has near-encyclopedic knowledge of all things Beyoncé.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MayaTPrabhu/","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Maya","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5823","middleName":"T.","_id":"maya-t-prabhu","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/maya-t-prabhu/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Economy, education on the minds of lifelong Washington County voters"},"first_publish_date":"2024-05-31T12:00:03.112Z","last_updated_date":"2024-06-11T18:18:14.316Z","_id":"25PVGG55XVHR5GNJQHBOJXKDKI","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"ae4fe5e3ace4e7e715c5807143276f0dcd737922cef70f9e5854148a0a65ce70"},"credits":{"by":[{"name":"HYOSUB SHIN / AJC","type":"author"}]},"subtitle":"Washington County Voters","width":5426,"caption":"Tabitha Hatfield, 45, smiles while receiving a hug from one of her students, 6-year-old Rylee Pearson, at Elite Heat, Sandersville's athletic training facility.
