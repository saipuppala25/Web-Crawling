Her own education includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Delaware and a master’s degree from Columbia University. She has worked for newspapers in New Jersey and Florida and has covered many school boards. She has won many editorial writing awards, including a National Headliner award. She was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for her AJC editorials on the Genarlow Wilson case.

Cristina began the semester with a sense of purpose and a clearly recognizable desire to make the most of her time at Gainesville Middle School. Her focus toward this goal was among the most dedicated of all the interns I have worked with; Cristina demonstrated an impeccable desire to reflect upon her weaknesses in order to maximize her strengths in the classroom. She always listened and thought deeply and diligently about feedback and she consistently considered new techniques, methods, ideas and/or strategies that would allow her to become the best math or science teacher she could be. As the year continued, Cristina remained committed to this purpose and never waivered from her devotion to make the most from her experience. This reflective ability combines with her sense of humor, her ability to form relationships with students, and her extraordinary comfort with and knowledge of the content (for both science and math) to make me very confident that Cristina will be an excellent teacher."},{"_id":"UFMGZKSKIVEHBJ4AK4NBZRXJ4A","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[]},"type":"text","content":"Three of Cristina’s personal qualities stand out in my mind: chief among them is her confidence with and knowledge of the science and math content areas.

Her personal feedback to students needing support was timely, attentive, and well focused on encouraging the student to think his or her way through the learning material. Next, Cristina’s desire to rise to the challenges of life, her coursework, her internship, the edTPA process, and her learning matches the dedication with which she approaches her teaching. She takes a great deal of pride in her work and her teaching. She approached her studies, her internship, and the overall academic experience from a position of integrity that is focused on fairness, ethical practices, and solid work. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the fact that Cristina’s easy-going sense of humor allows her to understand and communicate effectively with middle school students.

Her own education includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Delaware and a master’s degree from Columbia University. She has worked for newspapers in New Jersey and Florida and has covered many school boards. She has won many editorial writing awards, including a National Headliner award. She was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for her AJC editorials on the Genarlow Wilson case.

she has written editorials and opinion pieces about local, state and federal education policy for more than 20 years. She’s also taught college classes in mass communications and journalism. However, she’s learned more about schools from having four children in them. Her own education includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Delaware and a master’s degree from Columbia University. She has worked for newspapers in New Jersey and Florida and has covered many school boards. She has won many editorial writing awards, including a National Headliner award. She was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for her AJC editorials on the Genarlow Wilson case. In June, the Education Writers Association named her Opinion Writer of the Year.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcgetschooled/","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Maureen","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5445","location":"Atlanta","_id":"maureen-downey","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/maureen-downey/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"School chief: AP African American Studies violates state law.

While highly technical skills are undoubtedly valuable, the demand that we develop graduates with such a narrow focus misses the broader implications of AI’s ascendance. The reality is that AI systems are amazing at taking on highly technical tasks.

Her own education includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Delaware and a master’s degree from Columbia University. She has worked for newspapers in New Jersey and Florida and has covered many school boards. She has won many editorial writing awards, including a National Headliner award.

Her own education includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Delaware and a master’s degree from Columbia University. She has worked for newspapers in New Jersey and Florida and has covered many school boards. She has won many editorial writing awards, including a National Headliner award. She was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for her AJC editorials on the Genarlow Wilson case. In June, the Education Writers Association named her Opinion Writer of the Year.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcgetschooled/","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Maureen","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5445","location":"Atlanta","_id":"maureen-downey","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/maureen-downey/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Opinion: Colleges want students to change the world, not take over the quad"},"first_publish_date":"2024-05-04T09:00:00.157Z","last_updated_date":"2024-05-06T15:42:45.807Z","_id":"VM5YBWOLPJEGLNHDZMFL5KSTXU","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"96959f9ecae9e7cf68a6809db1021a69b89d1a5d61a5bdc45ed9bf9b515a6922"},"credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"arvin.temkar@ajc.com","type":"author"}],"by":[{"name":"Arvin Temkar","type":"author"}]},"subtitle":"Emory University Protesters and Encampment\r","width":3300,"caption":"Police arrest pro-Palestinian protesters who set up an encampment at the Emory campus in Atlanta on Thursday, April 25, 2024.
