Chances for a stray shower go up tomorrow and gradually increase for the middle part of the week. “Not only will we have a little bit of rain around, we’re also going to have some cooler temperatures,” Channel 2 Action News meteorologist Brian Monahan said. “Northeast wind is going to drop us down to the 70s for highs.” Things should warm back up a bit for the weekend, and rain chances are expected to go down then, too.

The interchange was supposed to be open to traffic by the end of 2021 will not be ready until 2022. The Georgia Department of Transportation opened a new eastbound exit for Glenridge Drive and Ga. 400 northbound and southbound recently. Motorists merge onto collector-distributor lanes before Roswell Road to reach those exits. It’s the latest in a series of new traffic patterns as GDOT opens new ramps and lanes at the I-285 interchange at Ga. 400. Last month the agency opened a new I-285 westbound exit onto Ga. 400. It may have felt like midsummer in Atlanta on Thursday, Sept. 22, 2022 but fall weather snuck in overnight. A cold front moving through the region after sunset was nearly perfectly timed for the fall equinox at 9:03 p.m. and the official start of fall, according to Channel 2 Action News meteorologist Brian Monahan. Temperatures will drop on the other side of the front, setting up Atlanta for a cool start Friday on the first full day of the new season. We’re going to go from 94 today down to 80 degrees,” he said. Atlanta should start Friday at 60 degrees, and there will be 40s and 50s outside the Perimeter, according to Monahan. There is no rain in Saturday’s forecast, but the heat will turn up slightly with a projected high of 84 degrees for Atlanta. Sunday will be even warmer with a high of 88, and Monahan is calling for a 40% chance of a shower or thunderstorm.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"New doc spotlights former WNBA player as social activist, Atlanta Dream owner"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-16T10:00:00.847Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-16T10:00:00.847Z","_id":"Z2GCFKJCCREQLMTXZUPJXFLAC4","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"0819a3385fcc791103d5dcd8740d34f9487ffb08a85fe05ed902c80c97651e2f"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"ROKU","type":"author","byline":"ROKU"}]},"subtitle":"Renee Montgomery","width":6240,"caption":"Renee Montgomery, the former WNBA player, became an unexpected owner of the Atlanta Dream after a conflict between the players and owner Kelly Loeffler.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Ryan Seacrest gifts Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta a new studio for kids"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-12T20:25:02.365Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-14T13:00:53.799Z","_id":"WY6O3MGDDBBHFEKK3QOLIMRQ2M","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"d4ce8719d7e98710d2fdf5acf6a5a14d47ea6df10e54fb0eafd6ef68ee5e7b39"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"RODNEY HO","type":"author","byline":"RODNEY HO"}]},"subtitle":"Meredith and Ryan Seacrest","width":1800,"caption":"Meredith and Ryan Seacrest at the opening of Seacrest Studios, a special multimedia playground for the patients at Arthur M.

I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

Chances for a stray shower go up tomorrow and gradually increase for the middle part of the week. “Not only will we have a little bit of rain around, we’re also going to have some cooler temperatures,” Channel 2 Action News meteorologist Brian Monahan said. “Northeast wind is going to drop us down to the 70s for highs.” Things should warm back up a bit for the weekend, and rain chances are expected to go down then, too.

25, 2023 Atlanta: The Monday morning sky really put on a show in Midtown Atlanta for the kickoff for the first week of fall with warm, dry conditions. It was a chilly to start with temperatures in the high 50s and low 60s in most areas ahead of daybreak.  Chances for a stray shower go up tomorrow and gradually increase for the middle part of the week. “Not only will we have a little bit of rain around, we’re also going to have some cooler temperatures,” Channel 2 Action News meteorologist Brian Monahan said. “Northeast wind is going to drop us down to the 70s for highs.” Things should warm back up a bit for the weekend, and rain chances are expected to go down then, too.
