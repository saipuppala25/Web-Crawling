I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"New doc spotlights former WNBA player as social activist, Atlanta Dream owner"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-16T10:00:00.847Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-16T10:00:00.847Z","_id":"Z2GCFKJCCREQLMTXZUPJXFLAC4","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"0819a3385fcc791103d5dcd8740d34f9487ffb08a85fe05ed902c80c97651e2f"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"ROKU","type":"author","byline":"ROKU"}]},"subtitle":"Renee Montgomery","width":6240,"caption":"Renee Montgomery, the former WNBA player, became an unexpected owner of the Atlanta Dream after a conflict between the players and owner Kelly Loeffler.

It was shortly after he arrived in Atlanta from Florida that the city’s fortunes skyrocketed – Atlanta won the Olympic Games, the Braves went from worst to first, Evander Holyfield ascended to the heavyweight championship. He thinks it was merely coincidence, but who can know for sure? Steve Hummer writes columns and sports features for the AJC, mainly for the Sunday section. He covers a range of sports and topics. He has been privileged to cover Bobby Cox back when he had his original knees and Mark Richt when he had his own hips. Man, those guys are getting old. His most prized artifact is a trophy sent him by an angry friend of former Falcons’ coach and cowboy impersonator Jerry Glanville that features Hummer’s column photo taped on the south end of a north bound jackass.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"New doc spotlights former WNBA player as social activist, Atlanta Dream owner"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-16T10:00:00.847Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-16T10:00:00.847Z","_id":"Z2GCFKJCCREQLMTXZUPJXFLAC4","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"0819a3385fcc791103d5dcd8740d34f9487ffb08a85fe05ed902c80c97651e2f"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"ROKU","type":"author","byline":"ROKU"}]},"subtitle":"Renee Montgomery","width":6240,"caption":"Renee Montgomery, the former WNBA player, became an unexpected owner of the Atlanta Dream after a conflict between the players and owner Kelly Loeffler.
