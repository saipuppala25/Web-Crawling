I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Ryan Seacrest gifts Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta a new studio for kids"},"first_publish_date":"2024-10-12T20:25:02.365Z","last_updated_date":"2024-10-14T13:00:53.799Z","_id":"WY6O3MGDDBBHFEKK3QOLIMRQ2M","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"d4ce8719d7e98710d2fdf5acf6a5a14d47ea6df10e54fb0eafd6ef68ee5e7b39"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"RODNEY HO","type":"author","byline":"RODNEY HO"}]},"subtitle":"Meredith and Ryan Seacrest","width":1800,"caption":"Meredith and Ryan Seacrest at the opening of Seacrest Studios, a special multimedia playground for the patients at Arthur M.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ajcrodneyho","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[{"name":"Oyster Bay High School, 1987"},{"name":"Princeton University, B.A., political economics, 1991"},{"name":"George State University Robinson School, MBA marketig, 2007"}],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2024-08-03T14:43:47.124Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/e75580df-c242-40ff-b2b4-9809bdbda069.jpg","expertise":"2, Film, TV, radio, comedy, things to do around town, business","beat":"Entertatinment","author_type":"Staff","type":"author","bio_page":"/staff/rodney-ho/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/rodneyhoajc/","custom_ajc_website":"ajc"}}}]},"description":{"basic":"David Cross, who grew up in Roswell, loves being an older dad at age 60 to a seven year old with his wife and actress Amber Tamlyn."},"display_date":"2024-10-12T11:00:00Z","distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"8aec2b8c-455c-4816-903d-79fc8fdf8019"},"headlines":{"basic":"David Cross, now 60, doesn’t mind being an older dad with a 7-year-old","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"label":{"team":{"display":true,"text":"features","url":""}},"language":"","owner":{"sponsored":false},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"EFVN5TNAUNBZJMZX3MBGCXEB3U","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/aF-pJ6GtoU_VYj1b_3TqyFh9rok=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/EFVN5TNAUNBZJMZX3MBGCXEB3U.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","keywords":[],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"David Cross Worst Daddy in the World.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/EFVN5TNAUNBZJMZX3MBGCXEB3U.jpg","owner":"rodney.ho@ajc.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/aF-pJ6GtoU_VYj1b_3TqyFh9rok=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/EFVN5TNAUNBZJMZX3MBGCXEB3U.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/aF-pJ6GtoU_VYj1b_3TqyFh9rok=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/EFVN5TNAUNBZJMZX3MBGCXEB3U.jpg","restricted":false,"thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/f_ppTPzjMZVTiXN1BlJaYVit2tk=/300x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/EFVN5TNAUNBZJMZX3MBGCXEB3U.jpg","version":0,"template_id":594},"address":{},"auth":{"1":"f706fc434a54b4a610fb70bc9cef7ec5518c2f7b123771407dba9133e7fadbbd"},"caption":"David Cross, who is touring all around North America in the fall of 2024, is coming to the Tabernacle Oct. 16, 2024.

He cut his teeth in sports journalism as a breaking news writer within the mixed martial arts industry — all after earning a bachelor's degree in journalism and a bachelor's degree in English from Georgia State University.\n\nHe dedicated the following years of his career to working as a digital content producer for Cox Media Group, writing stories and crafting breaking news within the multiple-time Edward Murrow Award winning 95.5 WSB-Radio newsroom.\n\nMoving from radio to television, the next chapter of his career featured a digital producer position at WXIA-11Alive, one of Atlanta's top television news stations within the nation's top sixth market. Throughout his career, Hunter has gone on to write sports, entertainment, political and local breaking news for a variety of outlets.\n\nA nerd at heart, Hunter usually has a video game controller in his hands when he's not working. When not leveling up in the latest game, he's usually searching for new records to listen to or obsessing over Dungeons and
