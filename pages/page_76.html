To recoup costs, banks lower interest rates on deposits, charge higher fees and increase interest rates on loans.

As the storm tore through, it brought down power lines and communication towers, uprooted large trees and turned road signs into airborne missiles. The winds cut off entire communities from essential services. Landfalling hurricanes pose numerous dangers, especially in areas like the Big Bend, where dense tree cover is prevalent. One major risk is losing access to essential resources such as food and gas. Power outages can make it difficult to keep perishables safe and limit access to fuel for generators or vehicles. Additionally, falling trees can block escape routes, particularly in flood-prone areas, trapping residents and complicating evacuation efforts. This combination of factors can leave communities vulnerable and hinder effective recovery in the aftermath of a storm. Once the storm passed, I spent hours clearing trees from roadways, navigating through the debris to help others escape and ensure valuable resources could reach those in need."},{"_id":"ZRKECYVS4NF35MHN6GHGGGCCFU","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1728480486512},"alignment":"left","type":"text","content":"Hurricane Helene was the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-climate-change-florida-big-bend-182d68761b3d2328e56e3fb8d9cdb802\" target=\"_blank\">third hurricane to strike the Big Bend</a> region in just 13 months.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ajcrodneyho","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[{"name":"Oyster Bay High School, 1987"},{"name":"Princeton University, B.A., political economics, 1991"},{"name":"George State University Robinson School, MBA marketig, 2007"}],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2024-08-03T14:43:47.124Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/e75580df-c242-40ff-b2b4-9809bdbda069.jpg","expertise":"2, Film, TV, radio, comedy, things to do around town, business","beat":"Entertatinment","author_type":"Staff","type":"author","bio_page":"/staff/rodney-ho/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/rodneyhoajc/","custom_ajc_website":"ajc"}}}]},"description":{"basic":""},"display_date":"2024-10-16T10:00:00Z","distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"8aec2b8c-455c-4816-903d-79fc8fdf8019"},"headlines":{"basic":"New doc spotlights former WNBA player as social activist, Atlanta Dream owner","meta_title":"New Renee Montgomery documentary spotlights social activism","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"label":{"team":{"display":true,"text":"features","url":""}},"language":"","owner":{"sponsored":false},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/xWEp9_tEn8J1XyFV4YhiaTshHWg=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","iptc_source":"DSCF0525.RAF","keywords":[],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"Renee Montgomery 2024.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","owner":"rodney.ho@ajc.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/xWEp9_tEn8J1XyFV4YhiaTshHWg=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/xWEp9_tEn8J1XyFV4YhiaTshHWg=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","restricted":false,"takenOn":"2022-09-30T19:04:07Z","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/WsLUD__alkfWCTFfJGHUk4TpVRs=/300x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","version":0,"template_id":594},"address":{},"auth":{"1":"0819a3385fcc791103d5dcd8740d34f9487ffb08a85fe05ed902c80c97651e2f"},"caption":"Renee Montgomery, the former WNBA player, became an unexpected owner of the Atlanta Dream after a conflict between the players and owner Kelly Loeffler.
