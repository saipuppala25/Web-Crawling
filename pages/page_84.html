Jennifer is the former government editor of The (Nashville) Tennessean newspaper and has more than 25 years’ experience as a reporter and editor in four states. She helped gather and compile the data that would form the basis for the AJC's 2022 \"Dangerous Dwellings\" series, which won an IRE Award given out by the group Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc. and won first place in its category in the National Headliner Awards. In 2019, she was part of an AJC team whose reporting on sexual harassment in Georgia state government prompted an overhaul of how the state deals with that issue. In 2015, she was a part of a combined AJC/WSB-TV team that was a finalist for the Tom Renner Award given out by the organization Investigative Reporters and Editors for the \"Over the Line\" series on police use of force. She is also the 2009 winner of the John Aubuchon Freedom of Information Award from the group Capitolbeat and the 2009 Open Doors Award from the Fort Worth Pro Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. Jennifer is a sixth-generation native Georgian. She grew up in Warrenton, Ga., a town of about 2,000 residents roughly an hour's drive west of Augusta. Her grandparents moved to Warrenton in 1952. Jennifer is interested in genealogy -- her father's family, the Peebleses and the Stranges, are from Emanuel County, and on her mother's side, she has roots in Greene, Morgan and Union counties. She welcomes contact with others who are researching the family lines.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ajcrodneyho","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[{"name":"Oyster Bay High School, 1987"},{"name":"Princeton University, B.A., political economics, 1991"},{"name":"George State University Robinson School, MBA marketig, 2007"}],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2024-08-03T14:43:47.124Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/e75580df-c242-40ff-b2b4-9809bdbda069.jpg","expertise":"2, Film, TV, radio, comedy, things to do around town, business","beat":"Entertatinment","author_type":"Staff","type":"author","bio_page":"/staff/rodney-ho/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/rodneyhoajc/","custom_ajc_website":"ajc"}}}]},"description":{"basic":""},"display_date":"2024-10-16T10:00:00Z","distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"8aec2b8c-455c-4816-903d-79fc8fdf8019"},"headlines":{"basic":"New doc spotlights former WNBA player as social activist, Atlanta Dream owner","meta_title":"New Renee Montgomery documentary spotlights social activism","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"label":{"team":{"display":true,"text":"features","url":""}},"language":"","owner":{"sponsored":false},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/xWEp9_tEn8J1XyFV4YhiaTshHWg=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","iptc_source":"DSCF0525.RAF","keywords":[],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"Renee Montgomery 2024.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","owner":"rodney.ho@ajc.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/xWEp9_tEn8J1XyFV4YhiaTshHWg=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/xWEp9_tEn8J1XyFV4YhiaTshHWg=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","restricted":false,"takenOn":"2022-09-30T19:04:07Z","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/WsLUD__alkfWCTFfJGHUk4TpVRs=/300x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","version":0,"template_id":594},"address":{},"auth":{"1":"0819a3385fcc791103d5dcd8740d34f9487ffb08a85fe05ed902c80c97651e2f"},"caption":"Renee Montgomery, the former WNBA player, became an unexpected owner of the Atlanta Dream after a conflict between the players and owner Kelly Loeffler.

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist on the AJC's investigative team. He currently serves as an investigations editor, but for years worked as a reporter on the team. He is an Atlanta native and a graduate of the University of Georgia. Brad has written about police misconduct, abuse of aged and vulnerable citizens, and government accountability. He was part of the team that investigated Georgia's senior care homes in 2019 in the \"Unprotected\" series. That led to legislative reform in 2020 to increase protections for Georgia's seniors. He was the AJC's lead reporter on a series that detailed police shootings across Georgia. That collaboration with WSB-TV resulted in legislative reform of the state’s grand jury system in 2016. In 2013, he was part of a team at the Minneapolis Star Tribune awarded a Pulitzer for a series that exposed widespread safety failures that had been harming infants and children in Minnesota’s daycare system. Previously, he worked as an investigative reporter and editor for The Tennessean in Nashville.  Brad welcomes news tips and comments from readers.

Jennifer is the former government editor of The (Nashville) Tennessean newspaper and has more than 25 years’ experience as a reporter and editor in four states. She helped gather and compile the data that would form the basis for the AJC's 2022 \"Dangerous Dwellings\" series, which won an IRE Award given out by the group Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc. and won first place in its category in the National Headliner Awards. In 2019, she was part of an AJC team whose reporting on sexual harassment in Georgia state government prompted an overhaul of how the state deals with that issue. In 2015, she was a part of a combined AJC/WSB-TV team that was a finalist for the Tom Renner Award given out by the organization Investigative Reporters and Editors for the \"Over the Line\" series on police use of force. She is also the 2009 winner of the John Aubuchon Freedom of Information Award from the group Capitolbeat and the 2009 Open Doors Award from the Fort Worth Pro Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. Jennifer is a sixth-generation native Georgian. She grew up in Warrenton, Ga., a town of about 2,000 residents roughly an hour's drive west of Augusta. Her grandparents moved to Warrenton in 1952. Jennifer is interested in genealogy -- her father's family, the Peebleses and the Stranges, are from Emanuel County, and on her mother's side, she has roots in Greene, Morgan and Union counties. She welcomes contact with others who are researching the family lines.

She has uncovered millions in misspent dollars and exposed shoddy decision-making that has resulted in financial nightmares. Her work has prompted changes in policies, removal of public officials and improvements in the lives of vulnerable people.

She graduated from the University of Southern California within three years of admission, earning a bachelor’s in print journalism with a minor in business administration. Much of her work as a journalist in California, Texas and Georgia has focused on trying to unwind complex financial topics, including public pensions, conduit bonds, hospital finance and public construction projects. She has uncovered millions in misspent dollars and exposed shoddy decision-making that has resulted in financial nightmares. Her work has prompted changes in policies, removal of public officials and improvements in the lives of vulnerable people. She is a believer in the fundamental principles of American journalism and its duty to serve and foster an informed public.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/yamil.berard","twitter":"https://twitter.com/yberard","custom_ajc_phone":"817-715-1528","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2023-06-12T22:45:25.640Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/adf3f1e4-07ab-45a3-bf30-1673e114f32a.jpg","languages":"Fluent in Spanish, written and oral; strong grasp of French","location":"Atlanta","author_type":"Staff","custom_ajc_website":"ajc"}}},{"_id":"Eric-Fan","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Eric Fan","image":{"url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/b74a6f7d-0d66-49b3-9ee4-2e49b88fd0ff.png","version":"0.5.8"},"description":"Eric Fan is a data reporter and visualization developer at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
