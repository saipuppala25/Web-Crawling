Those are kind of like the three primary, I guess, roles, you would say, and then through the hospital. I think what Scott said is a really good point. You also have that word of mouth spreading through the hospital, families that have had an interaction with support now, and so families just talking in the hallways. You know, we we've see, sadly, of a lot of registries come through Aflac Cancer Center, Blood Disorder Center, and so that's very tight knit community. They talk and they care deeply about each other, and so they're sharing, not Are they just sharing advice, they're sharing resources. So that's certainly the the lane for hospitals and then on nonprofits again, it it really ranges on the type of nonprofit, but a lot of times, you know, there's some nonprofits that are there to raise money, and then there's some nonprofits that are there to really serve families, as they are kind of coming to terms with a diagnosis, and with those nonprofits, they are often looking to expand their resources to families. And we fit that so beautifully, because, again, it's a free offering, and we know that we save families time, and we allow them to to have more of the money. And so it's been, it's been wonderful to be able to to create this like web of relationships and partnerships, because they kind of all go together. You know, all these organizations, they all, they all tend. Of work in concert, and so we're kind of in that ecosystem.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ajcrodneyho","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[{"name":"Oyster Bay High School, 1987"},{"name":"Princeton University, B.A., political economics, 1991"},{"name":"George State University Robinson School, MBA marketig, 2007"}],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2024-08-03T14:43:47.124Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/e75580df-c242-40ff-b2b4-9809bdbda069.jpg","expertise":"2, Film, TV, radio, comedy, things to do around town, business","beat":"Entertatinment","author_type":"Staff","type":"author","bio_page":"/staff/rodney-ho/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/rodneyhoajc/","custom_ajc_website":"ajc"}}}]},"description":{"basic":""},"display_date":"2024-10-16T10:00:00Z","distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"8aec2b8c-455c-4816-903d-79fc8fdf8019"},"headlines":{"basic":"New doc spotlights former WNBA player as social activist, Atlanta Dream owner","meta_title":"New Renee Montgomery documentary spotlights social activism","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"label":{"team":{"display":true,"text":"features","url":""}},"language":"","owner":{"sponsored":false},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/xWEp9_tEn8J1XyFV4YhiaTshHWg=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","iptc_source":"DSCF0525.RAF","keywords":[],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"Renee Montgomery 2024.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","owner":"rodney.ho@ajc.com","proxyUrl":"/resizer/xWEp9_tEn8J1XyFV4YhiaTshHWg=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/xWEp9_tEn8J1XyFV4YhiaTshHWg=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","restricted":false,"takenOn":"2022-09-30T19:04:07Z","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/WsLUD__alkfWCTFfJGHUk4TpVRs=/300x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/FDKLDCAWW5AJ5JAC74FAFSWBNI.jpg","version":0,"template_id":594},"address":{},"auth":{"1":"0819a3385fcc791103d5dcd8740d34f9487ffb08a85fe05ed902c80c97651e2f"},"caption":"Renee Montgomery, the former WNBA player, became an unexpected owner of the Atlanta Dream after a conflict between the players and owner Kelly Loeffler.
