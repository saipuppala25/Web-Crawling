As the storm tore through, it brought down power lines and communication towers, uprooted large trees and turned road signs into airborne missiles. The winds cut off entire communities from essential services. Landfalling hurricanes pose numerous dangers, especially in areas like the Big Bend, where dense tree cover is prevalent. One major risk is losing access to essential resources such as food and gas. Power outages can make it difficult to keep perishables safe and limit access to fuel for generators or vehicles. Additionally, falling trees can block escape routes, particularly in flood-prone areas, trapping residents and complicating evacuation efforts. This combination of factors can leave communities vulnerable and hinder effective recovery in the aftermath of a storm. Once the storm passed, I spent hours clearing trees from roadways, navigating through the debris to help others escape and ensure valuable resources could reach those in need."},{"_id":"ZRKECYVS4NF35MHN6GHGGGCCFU","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1728480486512},"alignment":"left","type":"text","content":"Hurricane Helene was the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-climate-change-florida-big-bend-182d68761b3d2328e56e3fb8d9cdb802\" target=\"_blank\">third hurricane to strike the Big Bend</a> region in just 13 months.
