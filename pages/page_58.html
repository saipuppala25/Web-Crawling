They’re packaged in a brine that we were tempted to drink right from the container. After the pickles are gone, you can take that brine and shake it up with some olive oil for a perfect vinaigrette.

We sampled the original and the hot flavor, and the latter was our favorite. It gets its heat from a special mix of mustard seeds. This mustard is saucy, not thick, and is perfect for brushing onto proteins before or after grilling, for stirring into cold potato or pasta salad, and for making into a vinaigrette. Our guests also enjoyed it as a dipping sauce for pretzel sticks and vegetables and loved the deviled eggs that we made using the original flavor and a little bit of dill pickle relish."},{"_id":"MUJR4OMC2VGLLCXXEQEW63AOGQ","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1724867295324},"type":"text","content":"<i>$11 per 8-ounce jar, $12 per 10-ounce bottle.

Lamb’s strong flavor can stand up to equally robust seasoning, and in this recipe that comes in the form of lemongrass, fish sauce and fresh lime juice. Prepared lemongrass paste, usually found near the herbs in the grocery store produce department, is a great timesaver — no need to peel, bruise and chop the lemongrass before using. An equal amount of fish sauce provides all of the salt and tangy lime juice (plus a bit of sugar for balance) evens out the marinade’s funky salinity. Marinating for 10 minutes provides enough time to season the exterior of the meat; cooking the excess to make a quick sauce after searing the chops doubles down on its flavors."},{"_id":"4WL2V3TUWRF4HPW4WYAUCMEIZE","additional_properties":{"comments":[],"_id":"YJ6O34MA6JHUJKF2XV76WFWGRI"},"type":"interstitial_link","content":"Easy weeknight dinner recipes","url":"https://www.ajc.com/things-to-do-530-challenge/"},{"_id":"N5TW7MA3RNGL5N5CRKPNQT2K2E","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725368313553},"type":"text","content":"<b>Lemongrass Lamb Chops</b>"},{"_id":"BYOJEKXOLRCGHESJ7AJL57ZUFA","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725368313554},"type":"text","content":"2 tablespoons ready-made<b> </b>lemongrass paste"},{"_id":"RDEB3E3SZVE57NM3XVPB465DNA","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725368313555},"type":"text","content":"2 tablespoons fish sauce"},{"_id":"JKDSQCZPXRF5PGH4RCVSC6GVY4","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725368313556},"type":"text","content":"4 teaspoons fresh lime juice, plus lime wedges for serving"},{"_id":"IDJCMNIPXRB5FBBKIINIYJA2ME","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725368313557},"type":"text","content":"2 teaspoons granulated sugar"},{"_id":"BQP7I5EYXRCD3EDE2P4BC7AG2E","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725368313558},"type":"text","content":"4 lamb rib chops"},{"_id":"2EJM65YWVFGWLF5QV62POLS2EA","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725368313559},"type":"text","content":"1 tablespoon canola oil"},{"_id":"HYRSS6WBS5D5BJOCAZ2IO4GDN4","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725368313560},"type":"text","content":"1/4 cup water"},{"_id":"I35D6GUK2NEW5DUAZ4D4TIGCGA","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1725368313561},"type":"text","content":"In a shallow bowl, whisk together the lemongrass paste, fish sauce, lime juice and sugar.

Examine it and make certain it is free of yolk and shell. Transfer it to the second bowl where you will collect all of the egg whites. Place the yolk in the third bowl.
