I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows.

A veteran of nearly 30 years as a newspaper reporter, he previously reported for newspapers in New York City and Durham, covering stories ranging from politics to civil rights to higher education. Since 2016, he has managed the AJC’s award-winning Black History Month project through AJC Sepia, the paper’s Black news curation site. He is the author of the book, \"The Many Lives of Andrew Young,\" and the writer and producer of the Emmy-nominated hip-hop documentary, \"The South Got Something to Say.\" A 1990 graduate of North Carolina Central University, with a degree in English Literature, Suggs was also a 2009 Harvard University Nieman Fellow. He is currently on the Nieman Foundation’s Board of Trustees and the former national vice president of the National Association of Black Journalists. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Rocky Mount, N.C., his obsession for Prince, Spike Lee movies, Hamilton and the New York Yankees is unmatched.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcsepia","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Ernie","books":[{"publisher":"","title":"","url":""}],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5672","_id":"ernie-suggs","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/ernie-suggs/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Granddaughter of Medgar and Myrlie Evers found safe"},"first_publish_date":"2024-09-27T16:48:03.401Z","last_updated_date":"2024-09-28T01:16:11.99Z","_id":"Z4MDPR7WHZD6TNNACJT2CTSM5Y","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"e6958ed6fd9cba8328923539d32533c78de8d39ebf8fe668a568c31fadcfbbbb"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"Gwinnett County Police Department","type":"author","byline":"Gwinnett County Police Department"}]},"subtitle":"Nicole Evers-Everette","width":677,"caption":"Nicole Evers-Everette","type":"image","distributor":{"mode":"reference","reference_id":"8aec2b8c-455c-4816-903d-79fc8fdf8019"},"url":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/UJQZ6HBGSNC4NPNTBWV75EQDGY.PNG","height":421,"resized_obj":{"src":"https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/UJQZ6HBGSNC4NPNTBWV75EQDGY.PNG?auth=e6958ed6fd9cba8328923539d32533c78de8d39ebf8fe668a568c31fadcfbbbb&width=330&height=330&smart=true"}}},{"content_elements":[{"_id":"LAC6RSYR3NBFZLMR4RJLWYQ56E","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1727278498604},"type":"text","content":"Felicia Flores’ hair was her crowning glory.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Tyrese Gibson relives L.A. riots in ‘1992′ thriller with Ray Liotta"},"first_publish_date":"2024-08-30T15:48:01.51Z","last_updated_date":"2024-08-30T15:48:01.625Z","_id":"SHZB7KIU3REA5GADLLTL6G7RIY","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"99de5ee45f3cb3ee2be8c40ebc838b590d696a252dac4c05cce5430d5ff9536e"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"LION","type":"author","byline":"LION"}]},"subtitle":"Tyrese Gibson","width":1400,"caption":"Tyrese Gibson plays a father trying to make it through the LA. riots of 1992 in the film \"1992\" in theaters Aug. 30, 2024.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Black nerds (or Blerds) create a space for themselves at Dragon Con "},"first_publish_date":"2024-08-21T10:00:02.711Z","last_updated_date":"2024-08-29T11:11:21.914Z","_id":"MH2WYFA7Q5FONKS43TKR3OCWDE","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"b8e6189d1969005e39f3b12a8e3ded62263079179a1e96161971f1875aa6a86a"},"credits":{"affiliation":[],"by":[{"name":"CONTRIBUTED","type":"author","byline":"CONTRIBUTED"}]},"subtitle":"Anthony Michael Phillips","width":1800,"caption":"Anthony Michael Phillips, a cosplay photographer at Dragon Con, takes pictures of regulars such as Jasmine James, aka CutiePieSensei.

Since 2016, he has managed the AJC’s award-winning Black History Month project through AJC Sepia, the paper’s Black news curation site. He is the author of the book, \"The Many Lives of Andrew Young,\" and the writer and producer of the Emmy-nominated hip-hop documentary, \"The South Got Something to Say.\" A 1990 graduate of North Carolina Central University, with a degree in English Literature, Suggs was also a 2009 Harvard University Nieman Fellow. He is currently on the Nieman Foundation’s Board of Trustees and the former national vice president of the National Association of Black Journalists. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Rocky Mount, N.C., his obsession for Prince, Spike Lee movies, Hamilton and the New York Yankees is unmatched.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcsepia","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Ernie","books":[{"publisher":"","title":"","url":""}],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5672","_id":"ernie-suggs","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/ernie-suggs/"}]},"subtype":"Article","headlines":{"basic":"Check out fresh Black culture programming this summer at seven Atlanta museums "},"first_publish_date":"2024-08-08T01:49:19.431Z","last_updated_date":"2024-08-12T21:38:23.874Z","_id":"FCIPPXCCI5CSBALVGICNY23EWM","teaseImageObject":{"auth":{"1":"485f87b46acbdd82db4b959d22700acf3eabeca3f05f4f640239940d42b13d28"},"credits":{"affiliation":[{"name":"Seeger Gray / AJC","type":"author"}],"by":[{"name":"Seeger Gray / AJC","type":"author"}]},"subtitle":"Center for Civil and Human Rights","width":5794,"caption":"CEO Jill Savitt, left, and Chief Program Officer Kama Pierce of the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, pose at an exhibit designed to immerse visitors in a civil rights era lunch counter sit-in protest in Atlanta on Thursday, July 11, 2024.
