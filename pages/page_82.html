I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"subtitle":"","width":620,"first_publish_date":"2015-06-01T15:20:09Z","_id":"6OCQTGGOQVJD2BFIPGBBSGHZTY","additional_properties":{"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/Wn00qHQcAIpyNH3qHS15HMwwhcc=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/6OCQTGGOQVJD2BFIPGBBSGHZTY.jpg","comments":[],"keywords":["radiotvtalk blog","radiotvtalk"],"proxyUrl":"/resizer/Wn00qHQcAIpyNH3qHS15HMwwhcc=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/6OCQTGGOQVJD2BFIPGBBSGHZTY.jpg","takenOn":"2015-06-01T15:20:09Z","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/ajc/6OCQTGGOQVJD2BFIPGBBSGHZTY.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/Wn00qHQcAIpyNH3qHS15HMwwhcc=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/6OCQTGGOQVJD2BFIPGBBSGHZTY.jpg","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/AFFQocTBCcWpynD7UjOTnoeZTGw=/300x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-ajc/public/6OCQTGGOQVJD2BFIPGBBSGHZTY.jpg","version":0,"originalName":"https://www.ajc.com//rw/Pub/p6/AJC/2015/06/01/Images/WPIMAGE_cmgajcradiotvtalk_21087.jpg","mime_type":"image/jpeg","restricted":false,"galleries":[],"_id":"3KLPK4DBVRC5FBID2IZL2A5BZE"},"created_date":"2020-06-21T03:28:21Z","last_updated_date":"2020-06-21T03:28:21Z","publish_date":"2015-06-01T15:20:09Z","height":348,"resized_obj":{"src":"https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/6OCQTGGOQVJD2BFIPGBBSGHZTY.jpg?auth=ca0ecaa605eab11ef4b29b84aa37d76c42878befbe7126ca12aa12f2eed71dc6&width=330&height=330&smart=true"}},{"_id":"EPNUIZRNNRAVVI3PYN6Y6P5Z6U","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1721329712331},"type":"text","content":"<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/24/what-the-data-says-about-crime-in-the-us/\" target=\"_blank\">Polls show Democrats </a>and Republicans both want government to reduce crime, although the latter are more vocal."},{"_id":"ZU5FP5GGS5FWNCSLOAWLHACZEY","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1721329712332},"type":"text","content":"Into that backdrop, you have Savannah being asked to show up and complain that prosecutors have been very mean and are targeting conservatives and Christians."},{"_id":"EFWBJR6Y6RBHTBTHJKAO7ZR6NY","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1721329712333},"type":"text","content":"“My family was persecuted by rogue prosecutors in Fulton County due to our public profile and conservative beliefs,” she said to cascades of boos."},{"_id":"BMF6YPTHBJCP3LXAOZRLUJVBII","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1721329712334},"type":"text","content":"Remember, Donald Trump got indicted in Fulton.

The busy road was closed Nov. 10 when a large apartment complex, the Reserve at LaVista Walk, was destroyed in a fire. The four-story building was completely burned out after two people set off fireworks on its roof, police said at the time. Atlanta fire Chief Rod Smith said the level of destruction was “a complete anomaly” likely due to the fire beginning on the roof, above the fire alarms and sprinkler system. Demolition began in early April after months of delays due to insurance claims and investigations. A contractor at the scene previously told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the City of Atlanta had expedited the permits to demolish the building. Lavista Road’s reopening should help with traffic after a planned closure that will go into effect Friday on North Druid Hills Road a few miles north. The Georgia Department of Transportation will shut down North Druid Hills Road between Buford Highway and West Druid Hills Road to demolish and reconstruct the bridge over the North Fork of Peachtree Creek. The closure is expected to last for three months. Lavista and North Druid Hills roads intersect in the North Druid Hills neighborhood, and both feed traffic across the interstate highways running centrally through Atlanta. The reopening of Lavista Road will help maintain a link between northern DeKalb County and Atlanta’s northern neighborhoods like Buckhead.

Two people were arrested after countless residents were forced to evacuate the Reserve at LaVista Walk apartments on Lavista Road around 10:35 p.m. Friday. Firefighters encountered heavy smoke and fire on the roof of the four-story building. All residents were able to evacuate in time, but 17 people were treated for smoke inhalation and various minor injuries, fire officials said. The blaze required more than 80 firefighters and burned for much of the day Saturday. “Incident Command upgraded the response to a second alarm and, ultimately, a third alarm for additional resources,” Atlanta police said. The investigation revealed that the fire may have started due to fireworks being ignited from the roof, police said. Robert Stokes, 42, and Charnelle Gunn, 24, were detained at the scene and booked into the Fulton County Jail on Saturday, according to officials. They are facing charges of first-degree criminal damage to property and reckless conduct.

The impact of the coronavirus in Georgia was evident everywhere on Thursday, March 26, 2020 - from less traveled streets, public service billboards and people staying home. Dr. Kathleen Toomey, the state public health commissioner, says the State of Georgia has several “hotspots” of outbreaks, including in Albany, Bartow County, Dublin and Rome. In “virtually all these cases,” at least some of the spread was linked to “large church services,” she said. In Dougherty County, for instance, the coronavirus outbreak has been traced to two funeral services in late February and early March. Toomey told clergy that churches, synagogues and mosques that have the technical capacity to offer online services should do so. “This is a short period of inconvenience and worry, but if we invest in this collectively as a community we can help stop this virus,” she said.
