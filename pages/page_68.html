Throughout the track, the digital wind instruments build an alluring melody that grows more intense as the song progresses, inviting listeners into Andre 3000′s foliage of wind-inspired musicality.","type":"text"},{"_id":"MIVOYAZMQJD7DPDQS2GW4TSKXU","additional_properties":{"_id":1700320705459,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"“<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/1D7g7ZejXNy4GdbDAPSg2i?si=9ee83bd718374eec\" target=\"_blank\">BuyPoloDisorder’s Daughter Wears a 3000® Button Down Embroidered</a>” features short and patchy Mayan flute sounds that are often so dizzying that you feel like you’re embarking on a long trip with no destination in mind. “<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/5lvdCRZG3XyQ7Ea0oKclCP?si=d11dcbdcfeae41c1\" target=\"_blank\">Dreams Once Buried Beneath the Dungeon Floor Slowly Sprout Into Undying Gardens</a>,” is the longest song on the album at roughly 17 minutes. It’s a nod to the Dungeon Family, the pioneering Atlanta-based hip-hop collective that made a star out of Andre 3000 and so many others. It’s awash in loopy guitar synths, blaring cymbals and meditative chords that sound like the type of track you listen to when you want to become grounded. And the longer you listen, the more immersed you become in the scattering cacophony of sounds. Because patience is indeed a virtue.","type":"text"},{"_id":"YNPJZQB4Z5BGPHVDI2EZ7DY6I4","additional_properties":{"_id":1700320705460,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"A shining moment on the album arrives on its third track, “<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/7763zdQtsUXNRKMDbahyK5?si=1118b3c8ec29419e\" target=\"_blank\">That Night in Hawaii When I Turned Into a Panther and Started Making These Low Register Purring Tones That I Couldn’t Control ... [Expletive] Was Wild.</a>” Inspired by an ayahuasca trip that the 48-year-old will never forget, the track sounds exactly like something that’s even more alluring if heard under the influence of drugs.

Do You Agree?</a>” is riddled in monotony. But even as the album’s intensity builds, its lack of soul and rhythm is often so biting that the appeal to listen to it again and again wanes. It contains the rich lineage and daring creativity of Black artists drifting away from sounds that they’re far too often pigeonholed in (from Stevie Wonder’s “Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants,” and D’Angelo’s “Voodoo” to Beyoncé’s “Renaissance” and Lil Yachty’s “Let’s Start Here”), but “New Blue Sun” doesn’t firmly nail the landing.","type":"text"},{"_id":"I6Q3SMHB4VCFPJSVRY3GIBJSME","additional_properties":{"_id":1700320705462,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"When translated in film, this becomes even more true.

Sometimes he walked around on his heels while holding his flute. Sometimes he looked disgruntled while seemingly struggling to tie his shoe for five minutes. Sometimes he placed his shoes underneath a cone and rested on it. Sometimes he waved his flute like it was a sword or a cane or a toy or a basketball.

An untold story is how hip-hop has always been a disrupter. The art form is essentially born out of Black teenagers taking the technology of the day and creating something out of nothing. That ingenuity has forever changed how music is made and how music is sold. Hip-hop’s pioneers are essentially tech nerds.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ajcrodneyho","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[{"name":"Oyster Bay High School, 1987"},{"name":"Princeton University, B.A., political economics, 1991"},{"name":"George State University Robinson School, MBA marketig, 2007"}],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2024-08-03T14:43:47.124Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/e75580df-c242-40ff-b2b4-9809bdbda069.jpg","expertise":"2, Film, TV, radio, comedy, things to do around town, business","beat":"Entertatinment","author_type":"Staff","type":"author","bio_page":"/staff/rodney-ho/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/rodneyhoajc/","custom_ajc_website":"ajc"}}}]},"subtype":"Blog","websites":{"ajc":{"website_section":{"_id":"/things-to-do","_website":"ajc","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Things to Do","description":"Find things to do in Atlanta, the AJC events calendar, Atlanta restaurants, Georgia festivals, things to do this weekend, Atlanta movie showtimes, festivals and concerts.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film and other entertainment subjects. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have an adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ajcrodneyho","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[{"name":"Oyster Bay High School, 1987"},{"name":"Princeton University, B.A., political economics, 1991"},{"name":"George State University Robinson School, MBA marketig, 2007"}],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2024-08-03T14:43:47.124Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/e75580df-c242-40ff-b2b4-9809bdbda069.jpg","expertise":"2, Film, TV, radio, comedy, things to do around town, business","beat":"Entertatinment","author_type":"Staff","type":"author","bio_page":"/staff/rodney-ho/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/rodneyhoajc/","custom_ajc_website":"ajc"}}}]},"subtype":"Blog","websites":{"ajc":{"website_section":{"_id":"/things-to-do","_website":"ajc","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Things to Do","description":"Find things to do in Atlanta, the AJC events calendar, Atlanta restaurants, Georgia festivals, things to do this weekend, Atlanta movie showtimes, festivals and concerts.
