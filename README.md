This is a Flask Python Web Crawler that takes in an initial set of seed URLs, keywords, and the number of pages and prints all of them out for the user. All of the pages collected are stored in the pages directory of the respective user, and the URLs visited are stored inside of the visited_urls.txt file of the respective user, which is hidden so that URLs and pages are not pre-loaded. When the crawling is done, it will take the user to a different page which shows all of the URLs collected.
